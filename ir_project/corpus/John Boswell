Books

The Royal Treasure (1977) is a detailed historical study of the Mudéjar Muslims in Aragon in the 14th century
Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality (1980) is a work which, according to Chauncey et al
(1989), "offered a revolutionary interpretation of the Western tradition, arguing that the Roman Catholic Church had not condemned gay people throughout its history, but rather, at least until the twelfth century, had alternately evinced no special concern about homosexuality or actually celebrated love between men
"  The book won a National Book Award and the Stonewall Book Award in 1981, but Boswell's thesis was criticized by Warren Johansson, Wayne R. Dynes and John Lauritsen, who believed that he had attempted to whitewash the historic crimes of the Christian Church against gay men
Homosexuality, Intolerance, and Christianity: A Critical Examination of John Boswell's Work

The Kindness of Strangers: Child Abandonment in Western Europe from Late Antiquity to the Renaissance (1988) is a scholarly study of the widespread practice of abandoning unwanted children and the means by which society tries to care for them
The title, as Boswell states in the Introduction, is inspired by a puzzling phrase Boswell had found in a number of documents: aliena misericordia, which might at first seem to mean "a strange kindness", is better translated "the kindness of strangers
"

The Marriage of Likeness: Same-Sex Unions in Pre-Modern Europe (New York: Villard, 1994) argues that the adelphopoiia liturgy was evidence that the attitude of the Christian church towards homosexuality has changed over time, and that early Christians did on occasion accept same-sex relationships
"People with a History: An Online Guide to Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Trans* History"
Fordham University, 1997
Rites of so-called "same-sex union" (Boswell's proposed translation) occur in ancient prayer-books of both the western and eastern churches
They are rites of adelphopoiesis, literally Greek for the making of brothers
Boswell, stated that these should be regarded as sexual unions similar to marriages
Boswell made many detailed translations of these rites in Same-Sex Unions, and stated that one mass gay wedding occurred only a couple of centuries ago in the Archbasilica of St
John Lateran, the cathedral seat of the Pope as Bishop of Rome
This is a highly controversial point of Boswell's text, as other scholars have dissenting views of this interpretation, and believe that they were instead rites of becoming adopted brothers, or "blood brothers

Boswell pointed out such evidence as an icon of two saints, Sergius and Bacchus (at St
Catherine's on Mount Sinai), and drawings, such as one he interprets as depicting the wedding feast of Emperor Basil I to his "partner", John
Boswell sees Jesus as fulfilling the role of the "pronubus" or in modern parallel, best man
Boswell's methodology and conclusions have been disputed by many historians

Faith and sexuality

Boswell was a Roman Catholic, having converted from the Episcopal Church of his upbringing at age 15
He remained a daily-mass Catholic up until his death, despite  differences with the church over sexual issues
Although he was orthodox in most of his beliefs, he strongly disagreed with his church's stated opposition to homosexual behavior and relationships
He was partnered with Jerone Hart for some twenty years until his death
Hart and Boswell are buried together at Grove Street Cemetery, New Haven, Connecticut
In "Revolutions, Universals, and Sexual Categories", Boswell compares the constructionist–essentialist positions to the realist–nominalist dichotomy
He also lists three types of sexual taxonomies:

 All or most humans are polymorphously sexual
external accidents, such as socio-cultural pressure, legal sanctions, religious beliefs, historical or personal circumstances determine the actual expression of each person's sexual feelings
 Two or more sexual categories, usually, but not always based on sexual object choice
 One type of sexual response [is] normal
all other variants abnormal
Death

Boswell died of complications from AIDS in the Yale infirmary in New Haven, Connecticut, on December 24, 1994, at age 47
Legacy

During the late 1980s, the influence of Michel Foucault’s writings led to the emergence of a social constructivist view of human sexuality which emphasised the historical and cultural specificity of sexual identities such as 'heterosexual' and 'homosexual'
Despite Boswell’s friendly relations with Foucault, he remained adamantly opposed to the French theorist’s views, which he characterised as a reemergence of medieval nominalism, and defended his own striking essentialism in the face of changing academic fashions
Since his death, Boswell’s work has come under criticism from medievalists and queer theorists, who—while acknowledging his personal courage in bringing the issue of sexuality into the academy—have pointed out the anachronism of speaking of "gay people" in pre-modern societies and have questioned the validity of Boswell’s conclusions
Paglia Boswell Reviews, The Washington Post, July 17, 1994Warren Johansson and William A. Percy, [http://www
medievalists
net/2011/05/08/homosexuality-in-the-middle-ages/ Homosexuality in the Middle Ages, "Medievalist
net", 2009]
Several other scholars, including Terry Castle and Ruth Vanita, have followed in Boswell’s footsteps, building up the field of lesbian and gay studies (as distinct from queer theory), and proposing that categorizations of humans by sexual predilection much predate the 19th century (where Foucault and his followers place it), both in the West (as in Plato’s Symposium) and in other cultures (e
g
, India)
In 2006, Boswell was named with online resources as an LGBT History Month Icon
