Gaiman was able to read at the age of four. He said, "I was a reader. I loved reading. Reading things gave me pleasure. I was very good at most subjects in school, not because I had any particular aptitude in them, but because normally on the first day of school they'd hand out schoolbooks, and I'd read them—which would mean that I'd know what was coming up, because I'd read it."<ref>{{cite book|last= Abbey|first= Cherie D.

He would later win the school English prize and the school reading prize, enabling him to finally acquire the third volume.<ref name="Abbey"/>

For his seventh birthday, Gaiman received [[C. S. Lewis]]'s ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' series. He later recalled that "I admired his use of parenthetical statements to the reader, where he would just talk to you ... I'd think, 'Oh, my gosh, that is so cool! I want to do that! When I become an author, I want to be able to do things in parentheses.' I liked the power of putting things in brackets."<ref name="Abbey"/> ''Narnia'' also introduced him to literary awards, specifically the 1956 [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]] won by the concluding volume. When Gaiman won the 2010 Medal himself, the press reported him recalling, "it had to be the most important literary award there ever was"<ref name=bbc/> and observing, "if you can make yourself aged seven happy, you're really doing well – it's like writing a letter to yourself aged seven."<ref name=flood/>

In the early 1980s, Gaiman pursued journalism, conducting interviews and writing book reviews, as a means to learn about the world and to make connections that he hoped would later assist him in getting published.<ref name="Abbey"/> He wrote and reviewed extensively for the British Fantasy Society.<ref name="NGB">{{cite web |url= http://www.neilgaimanbibliography.com/bookreviews.html|title= Works by Gaiman – Book Reviews|date= n.d.|work= NeilGaimanBibliography.com|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131017032546/http://neilgaimanbibliography.com/bookreviews.html|archivedate= 17 October 2013|deadurl= no}}</ref> His first professional short story publication was "Featherquest", a fantasy story, in ''[[Imagine (AD&D magazine)|Imagine Magazine]]'' in May 1984.<ref name="NGB" />

When waiting for a train at London's [[London Victoria station|Victoria Station]] in 1984, Gaiman noticed a copy of ''[[Swamp Thing]]'' written by [[Alan Moore]], and carefully read it.

I proceeded to make regular and frequent visits to London's [[Forbidden Planet (bookstore)|Forbidden Planet]] shop to buy comics".<ref name=MOR/>

In 1990, Gaiman wrote ''[[The Books of Magic]]'', a four-part mini-series that provided a tour of the mythological and magical parts of the [[DC Universe]] through a [[frame story]] about an English teenager who discovers that he is destined to be the world's greatest wizard.<ref>Manning "1990s" in Dolan, p. 247: "Neil Gaiman chronicled the adventures of magic pupil Timothy Hunter in this miniseries. each issue explored  the realms of magic as portrayed by a different painter."</ref> The miniseries was popular, and sired an ongoing series written by [[John Ney Rieber]].<ref name="sj">{{cite web|url=http://www.seriejournalen.dk/tegneserie_indhold.asp?ID=15 |title=Interview with John Ney Rieber |last=Andreasen |first=Henrik |publisher=Serie Journalen |date=1 December 1995 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620095158/http://www.seriejournalen.dk/tegneserie_indhold.asp?ID=15 |archivedate=20 June 2008 |deadurl= yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In the mid-1990s, he also created a number of new characters and a setting that was to be featured in a title published by [[Tekno Comix]].

Gaiman wrote a semi-autobiographical story about a boy's fascination with [[Michael Moorcock]]'s anti-hero [[Elric of Melniboné]] for [[Ed Kramer]]'s anthology ''Tales of the White Wolf.'' In 1996, Gaiman and [[Ed Kramer]] co-edited ''[[The Sandman: Book of Dreams]]''. Nominated for the [[British Fantasy Award]], the original fiction anthology featured stories and contributions by [[Tori Amos]], [[Clive Barker]], [[Gene Wolfe]], [[Tad Williams]], and others.

Asked why he likes comics more than other forms of storytelling, Gaiman said: "One of the joys of comics has always been the knowledge that it was, in many ways, untouched ground. It was virgin territory. When I was working on ''Sandman'', I felt a lot of the time that I was actually picking up a machete and heading out into the jungle. I got to write in places and do things that nobody had ever done before. When I’m writing novels I’m painfully aware that I’m working in a medium that people have been writing absolutely jaw-droppingly brilliant things for, you know, three-four thousand years now. You know, you can go back. We have things like ''[[The Golden Ass]]''. And you go, well, I don’t know that I’m as good as that and that's two and a half thousand years old. But with comics I felt like – I can do stuff nobody has ever done. I can do stuff nobody has ever thought of. And I could and it was enormously fun."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.wildriverreview.com/4/worldvoices-neilgaiman.php|title= Myth, Magic and the Mind of Neil Gaiman|first= Tim E.|last= Ogline|date= 20 November 2007|publisher= ''[[Wild River Review]]''|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120915045414/http://www.wildriverreview.com/4/worldvoices-neilgaiman.php|archivedate= 15 September 2012|deadurl= no}}</ref>

In a collaboration with author [[Terry Pratchett]], best known for his series of ''[[Discworld]]'' novels, Gaiman's first novel ''[[Good Omens]]'' was published in 1990. In 2011 Pratchett said that while the entire novel was a collaborative effort and most of the ideas could be credited to both of them, Pratchett did a larger portion of writing and editing if for no other reason than Gaiman's scheduled involvement with ''Sandman''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lspace.org/books/apf/words-from-the-master.html|first= Terry|last= Pratchett|title= Words from the Master|work= Lspace.org|date= n.d.|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130929041235/http://www.lspace.org/books/apf/words-from-the-master.html|archivedate= 29 September 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate=26 July 2011}}</ref>

The 1996 [[Neverwhere (novel)|novelisation]] of Gaiman's teleplay for the BBC mini-series ''[[Neverwhere]]'' was his first solo novel. The novel was released in tandem with the television series though it presents some notable differences from the television series. Gaiman has since revised the novel twice, the first time for an American audience unfamiliar with the [[London Underground]], the second time because he felt unsatisfied with the original.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Gaiman has not written a direct sequel to ''American Gods'' but he has revisited the characters. A glimpse at Shadow's travels in Europe is found in a short story which finds him in Scotland, applying the same concepts developed in ''American Gods'' to the story of ''[[Beowulf]]''. The 2005 novel ''[[Anansi Boys]]''  deals with [[Anansi]] ('Mr. Nancy'), tracing the relationship of his two sons, one semi-divine and the other an unassuming Englishman, as they explore their common heritage.

===Blog and Twitter===
In February 2001, when Gaiman had completed writing ''[[American Gods]]'', his publishers set up a promotional website featuring a [[weblog]] in which Gaiman described the day-to-day process of revising, publishing, and promoting the novel. After the novel was published, the website evolved into a more general Official Neil Gaiman Website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://neilgaiman.com/ |title=Official Neil Gaiman Website |work=Neilgaiman.com |date= |accessdate=26 July 2011}}</ref>

Gaiman generally posts to the blog describing the day-to-day process of being Neil Gaiman and writing, revising, publishing, or promoting whatever the current project is. He also posts reader emails and answers questions, which gives him unusually direct and immediate interaction with fans. One of his answers on why he writes the blog is "because writing is, like death, a lonely business."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://journal.neilgaiman.com/2008/02/m-is-for-mirrors-youll-stare-in-forever.html |title=Neil Gaiman's journal, 2/11/2008 |work=Journal.neilgaiman.com |date=11 February 2008 |accessdate=26 July 2011}}</ref>

Amos penned the introduction for his novel ''Death: the High Cost of Living'', and posed for the cover. She also wrote a song called "Sister Named Desire" based on his ''Sandman'' character, which was included on his anthology, ''Where's Neil When You Need Him?''.

==Litigation==
In 1993, Gaiman was contracted by [[Todd McFarlane]] to write a single issue of ''[[Spawn (comics)|Spawn]]'', a popular title at the newly-created [[Image Comics]] company. McFarlane was promoting his new title by having guest authors Gaiman, [[Alan Moore]], [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]], and [[Dave Sim]] each write a single issue.

In issue No. 9 of the series, Gaiman introduced the characters [[Angela (comics)|Angela]], [[Cogliostro]], and [[Hellspawn#Notable Hellspawn|Medieval Spawn]]. Prior to this issue, Spawn was an assassin who worked for the government and came back as a reluctant agent of Hell but had no direction. In Angela, a cruel and malicious angel, Gaiman introduced a character who threatened Spawn's existence, as well as providing a moral opposite. Cogliostro was introduced as a mentor character for exposition and instruction, providing guidance. Medieval Spawn introduced a history and precedent that not all Spawns were self-serving or evil, giving additional character development to [[Malebolgia]], the demon that creates Hellspawn.

As intended,<ref>See Judge Shabaz's ruling for the legal reasoning: "As a co-owner, McFarlane was not violating the Copyright Act by unilaterally publishing the jointly owned work, but, as in any other case of conversion or misappropriation, he would have to account to the other joint owner for the latter's share of the profits."</ref> all three characters were used repeatedly throughout the next decade by Todd McFarlane within the wider Spawn universe. In papers filed by  Gaiman in early 2002, however, he claimed that the characters were jointly owned by their scripter (himself) and artist (McFarlane), not merely by McFarlane in his role as the creator of the series.<ref>Listen to the "Oral Argument," [http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/fdocs/docs.fwx?caseno=03-1331&submit=showdkt&yr=03&num=1331.PD List of Documents in case: 03-1331 : Gaiman, Neil v.

McFarlane initially agreed that Gaiman had not signed away any rights to the characters, and negotiated with Gaiman to effectively 'swap' McFarlane's interest in the character [[Marvelman]]<ref>See Judge Shabaz's [http://vlex.com/vid/20111002 ruling]: "A tentative agreement was reached that... Gaiman would exchange his rights in Medieval Spawn and Cogliostro for McFarlane's rights in another comic book character, Miracleman."</ref> (McFarlane believes he purchased interest in the character when [[Eclipse Comics]] was liquidated; Gaiman is interested in being able to continue his aborted run of that title) but later claimed that Gaiman's work had been work-for-hire and that McFarlane owned all of Gaiman's creations entirely. The presiding judge, however, ruled against their agreement being work for hire, based in large part on the legal requirement that "copyright assignments must be in writing."<ref>Judge Shabaz, [http://vlex.com/vid/20111002 Official ruling], as per "Schiller & Schmidt, Inc. v.

On the specific issue of Cogliostro, presiding Judge [[John C. Shabaz]] proclaimed, "The expressive work that is the comic-book character Count Nicholas Cogliostro was the joint work of Gaiman and McFarlane—their contributions strike us as quite equal—and both are entitled to ownership of the copyright".<ref>See Judge Shabaz's [http://vlex.com/vid/20111002 ruling] for similar statements on Angela and Medieval Spawn.</ref> Similar analysis led to similar results for the other two characters, Angela and Medieval Spawn.

This legal battle was brought by Gaiman and the specifically formed Marvels and Miracles, [[Limited-liability company|LLC]], which Gaiman created to help sort out [[Marvelman#Ownership battle|the legal rights surrounding Marvelman]].

==Literary allusions==
Gaiman's work is known for a high degree of [[allusion|allusiveness]].<ref>See particularly Rodney Sharkey, James Fleming, and Zuleyha Cetiner-Oktem's articles in ''ImageTexT''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> special issue on Gaiman's work: [http://www.english.ufl.edu/imagetext/archives/v4_1/#Articles].</ref> Meredith Collins, for instance, has commented upon the degree to which his novel ''[[Stardust (novel)|Stardust]]'' depends on allusions to Victorian fairy tales and culture.<ref>Collins, Meredith. "Fairy and Faerie: Uses of the Victorian in Neil Gaiman's and Charles Vess's Stardust." ''ImageTexT'' 4.1. [http://www.english.ufl.edu/imagetext/archives/v4_1/collins/]</ref> Particularly in ''The Sandman'', literary figures and characters appear often; the character of Fiddler's Green is modelled visually on [[G. K. Chesterton]], both [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] appear as characters, as do several characters from within ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''<ref>See this detailed analysis: [http://www.satt.org/comic/02_10_faery_1.html].</ref> and ''[[The Tempest]]''. The comic also draws from numerous mythologies and historical periods.

Analyzing Gaiman's ''The Graveyard Book'', bibliographer and librarian [[Richard Bleiler]] detects patterns of and allusions to the Gothic novel, from Horace Walpole's [[The Castle of Otranto]] to Shirley Jackson's [[The Haunting of Hill House]]. He concludes that Gaiman is "utilizing works, characters, themes, and settings that generations of scholars have identified and classified as Gothic, ... [yet] subverts them and develops the novel by focusing on the positive aspects of maturation, concentrating on the values of learning, friendship, and sacrifice."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bleiler|first1=Richard|editor1-last=Olson|editor1-first=Danel|title=21st Century Gothic: Great Gothic Novels Since 2000|date=2011|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Plymouth, UK|isbn=9780810877283|pages=269-278|edition=1st|accessdate=16 July 2017|chapter=Raised by the Dead: The Maturational Gothic of Neil Gaiman's _The Graveyard Book_}}</ref> Regarding another work's assumed connection and allusions to this form, Gaiman himself quipped: "I've never been able to figure out whether ''Sandman'' is a gothic."<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Olson|first1=Danel|title=Casket Letters: The Essential Comics of Horror, Gothic, and the Weird for 2014|journal=The Weird Fiction Review|date=2014|volume=5|pages=285-291|publisher=Centipede Press|location=Lakewood, CO}}</ref>

Clay Smith has argued that this sort of allusiveness serves to situate Gaiman as a strong authorial presence in his own works, often to the exclusion of his collaborators.<ref>Smith, Clay. "Get Gaiman?: PolyMorpheus Perversity in Works by and about Neil Gaiman." ''ImageTexT'' 4.1. [http://www.english.ufl.edu/imagetext/archives/v4_1/smith/]</ref> However, Smith's viewpoint is in the minority: to many, if there is a problem with Gaiman scholarship and intertextuality it is that "... his literary merit and vast popularity have propelled him into the nascent comics canon so quickly that there is not yet a basis of critical scholarship about his work."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.english.ufl.edu/imagetext/archives/v4_1/introduction.shtml |title=A Special Issue on the Works of Neil Gaiman, Introduction |work=English.ufl.edu |date= |accessdate=26 July 2011}}</ref>

David Rudd takes a more generous view in his study of the novel ''[[Coraline]]'', where he argues that the work plays and riffs productively on [[Sigmund Freud]]'s notion of [[Uncanny|the Uncanny]], or the ''[[Unheimlich]]''.<ref>Rudd, David "An Eye for an 'I': Neil Gaiman's Coraline and the Question of Identity" ''Children's Literature and Education'' 39(3), 2008, pp. 159–168 [http://digitalcommons.bolton.ac.uk/emcs_journals/1/]</ref>

Though Gaiman's work is frequently seen as exemplifying the [[monomyth]] structure laid out in [[Joseph Campbell]]'s ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'',<ref>See Stephen Rauch, ''Neil Gaiman's The Sandman and Joseph Campbell: In Search of the Modern Myth'', Wildside Press, 2003</ref> Gaiman says that he started reading ''The Hero with a Thousand Faces'' but refused to finish it: "I think I got about half way through ''The Hero with a Thousand Faces'' and found myself thinking if this is true – I don’t want to know. I really would rather not know this stuff. I’d rather do it because it’s true and because I accidentally wind up creating something that falls into this pattern than be told what the pattern is."<ref>{{cite web|last=Ogline |first=Tim E. |url=http://www.wildriverreview.com/worldvoices-neilgaiman.php |title=The Wild River Review, "Interview with the Dream King" |work=Wildriverreview.com |date= |accessdate=26 July 2011}}</ref>
