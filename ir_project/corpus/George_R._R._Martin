'''George Raymond Richard Martin'''<ref name="middlename"/> (born '''George Raymond Martin'''; September 20, 1948), often referred to as '''George R. R. Martin''',<ref name="grrm"/> is an American [[novelist]] and [[short story|short-story]] writer in the [[fantasy fiction|fantasy]], [[horror fiction|horror]], and [[science fiction]] genres, screenwriter, and television producer. He is best known for his series of [[epic fantasy]] novels, ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'', which was later adapted into the [[HBO]] series ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' (2011–present). Martin serves as the series's co-executive producer, and also scripted four episodes of the series.

In 2005, [[Lev Grossman]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' called Martin "the American [[J. R. R.

The family first lived in a house on Broadway, belonging to Martin's great-grandmother. In 1953, they moved to a federal [[housing project]] near the Bayonne docks.<ref name=theheartofasmall/> During Martin's childhood, his world consisted predominantly of "First Street to Fifth Street", between his grade school and his home; this limited world made him want to travel and experience other places, but the only way of doing so was through his imagination, so he became a voracious reader.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://njmonthly.com/articles/jersey-living/george-rr-martin/|title=NJM Q&A: George R.R. Martin|date=2013-03-15|newspaper=New Jersey Monthly|access-date=2017-02-18|language=en-US}}</ref> The young Martin began writing and selling monster stories for pennies to other neighborhood children, dramatic readings included. He also wrote stories about a mythical kingdom populated by his pet turtles; the turtles died frequently in their toy castle, so he finally decided they were killing each other off in "sinister plots".{{r|berwick20120601}}

Martin attended Mary Jane Donohoe School and then later [[Marist High School (New Jersey)|Marist High School]]. While there he became an avid comic-book fan, developing a strong interest in the superheroes being published by [[Marvel Comics]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Rutkoff, Aaron|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2011/07/08/garden-state-tolkien-qa-with-george-r-r-martin/ |title=Garden State Tolkien: Q&A With George R.R.

'My four years at Marist High School were not the happiest of my life,' the author admits, although his growing enthusiasm for writing comics and superhero stories first emerged during this period."</ref> A letter Martin wrote to the editor of ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' was printed in issue No. 20 (Nov 1963); it was the first of many sent, e.g., ''FF'' #32, #34, and others. Fans who read his letters then wrote him letters in turn, and through such contacts, Martin joined the fledgling comics [[fandom]] of the era, writing fiction for various [[fanzines]];<ref name="dent20120612">{{cite video | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdSPFJcxCNM | title=Game Of Thrones – Interview with George R.R.

In 1970, Martin earned a B.S. in [[Journalism]] from [[Northwestern University]], [[Evanston, Illinois]], graduating ''[[summa cum laude]]''; he went on to complete his M.S. in Journalism in 1971, also from Northwestern.<ref name="D'Mmassa pages 388-390">D'Mmassa, Don "Martin, George" pages 388-390 from ''St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost and Gothic Writers'' edited by David Pringle, Detroit: St. James Press, 19978 page 388.</ref> Eligible for the [[Conscription in the United States|draft]] during the [[Vietnam War]], to which he [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|objected]], Martin applied for and obtained [[conscientious objector]] status;<ref>{{cite news|title=George Stroumboulopoulos Tonight, interview with Martin|url= http://www.cbc.ca/video/#/Shows/George_Stroumboulopoulos_Tonight/1595682788/ID=2209994735 |accessdate=March 15, 2012|newspaper=[[George Stroumboulopoulos Tonight]]|publisher=[[CBC.ca]]|date=March 14, 2012}}</ref> he instead did alternative service work for two years (1972–1974) as a [[Volunteers in Service to America|VISTA]] volunteer, attached to the [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]] Legal Assistance Foundation.<ref name="D'Mmassa pages 388-390"/>  An expert chess player, he also directed chess tournaments for the Continental Chess Association from 1973 to 1976.<ref>D'Amassa, Don "Martin, George" pages 388-390 from ''St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost and Gothic Writers'' edited by David Pringle, Detroit: St. James Press, 19978 page 388.</ref>

==Teaching==
In the mid-1970s, Martin met English professor [[George Guthridge]] from [[Dubuque, Iowa]], at a [[science fiction convention]] in [[Milwaukee]]. Martin persuaded Guthridge (who confesses that at that time he despised [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]]) not only to give [[speculative fiction]] a second look, but to write in the field himself. (Guthridge has since been a finalist for the Hugo Award and twice for the [[Nebula Award]] for science fiction and fantasy. In 1998, Guthridge and Janet Berliner won the [[Bram Stoker Award]] for Superior Achievement in the Novel for their ''Children of the Dust''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bram Stoker Awards|url=http://www.horror.org/awards/stokerwinnom.htm#1987|website=Horror Writers Association|accessdate=24 June 2017}}</ref>)

In turn, Guthridge helped Martin find a job at [[Clarke University]] (then Clarke College). Martin "wasn't making enough money to stay alive", from writing and the chess tournaments, says Guthridge.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.press-citizen.com/story/entertainment/go-iowa-city/2014/05/23/westeros-iowa/9517663/ |author=Munson, Kyle|title=Before Westeros, there was Iowa|work=[[Iowa City Press-Citizen]]|date= May 23, 2014}}</ref> From 1976 to 1978, Martin was an English and journalism instructor at Clarke, and he became Writer In Residence at the college from 1978 to 1979.<ref name="Contemporary Authors">{{cite web|title=George R.

While he enjoyed teaching, the sudden death of friend and fellow author [[Tom Reamy]] in late 1977 made Martin reevaluate his own life, and he eventually decided to try to become a full-time writer. He resigned from his job, and being tired of the hard winters in Dubuque, he moved to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] in 1979.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/vf-hollywood/george-r-r-martin-interview|title=George R.R.

==Writing career==
Martin began selling science fiction [[short stories]] professionally in 1970, at age 21. His first sale was "The Hero", sold to ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction|Galaxy]]'' magazine and published in its February 1971 issue; other sales soon followed. His first story to be nominated for the [[Hugo Award]]<ref>{{cite web|title=With Morning Comes Mistfall |url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1974-hugo-awards/ |publisher=Hugo Awards |accessdate=May 22, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303090430/http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1974-hugo-awards/ |archivedate=March 3, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref> and [[Nebula Award]]s was "[[With Morning Comes Mistfall]]", published in 1973 in ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Analog]]'' magazine. In 1975 his story "...for a single yesterday" about a post-apocalyptic timetripper was selected for inclusion in ''[[Epoch (anthology)|Epoch]]'', a science fiction anthology edited by Roger Elwood and Robert Silverberg. His first novel, ''[[Dying of the Light]]'', was published in 1977.

Martin is a member of the [[Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America]] (SFWA), Martin became the organization's Southwest Regional Director from 1977 to 1979; he served as its vice-president from 1996 to 1998.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} In 1976, for Kansas City's [[MidAmeriCon]], the [[34th World Science Fiction Convention]] ([[Worldcon]]), Martin and his friend and fellow writer-editor [[Gardner Dozois]] conceived of and organized the first Hugo Losers' Party for the benefit of all past and present Hugo-losing writers, their friends and families, the evening following the convention's Hugo Awards ceremony. Martin was nominated for two Hugos that year but lost both awards, for the novelette "...and Seven Times Never Kill Man" and the novella ''The Storms of Windhaven,'' co-written with [[Lisa Tuttle]].<ref name="Locusmag">{{cite news|url= http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/LocusNomList.html|work= The Locus|title= Index to SF Awards|accessdate= August 14, 2012|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090505221416/http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/LocusNomList.html|archivedate= May 5, 2009|df= mdy-all}}</ref> The Hugo Losers' Party became an annual Worldcon event thereafter, and its formal title later changed.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Although Martin often writes fantasy or horror, a number of his earlier works are science fiction tales occurring in a loosely defined [[future history]], known informally as "The Thousand Worlds" or "The Manrealm". He has also written at least one piece of political-military fiction, "Night of the Vampyres", collected in [[Harry Turtledove]]'s anthology ''The Best Military Science Fiction of the 20th Century'' (2001).<ref>{{cite news|title=Night of the Vampyres|author=Martin, George R.R.|editors=Turtledove, Harry with Greenberg, Martin H. |work=The Best Military Science Fiction of the 20th Century|location= New York|publisher= Ballantine|date= May 2001|pages= 279–306}}</ref>

In 1983, Martin published a vampire novel titled ''[[Fevre Dream]]'' set in the 19th century on the Mississippi River. Unlike traditional vampire novels, in ''Fevre Dream'' vampires are not supernatural creatures, but are rather a different species related to humans created by evolution with superhuman powers. Critic Don D'Amassa has praised ''Fevre Dream'' for its strong 19th century atmosphere and wrote: "This is without question one of the greatest vampire novels of all time".<ref name="D'Amassa pages 388-390">D'Amassa, Don "Martin, George" pages 388-390 from ''St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost and Gothic Writers'' edited by David Pringle, Detroit: St. James Press, 1997 page 390.</ref> Martin followed up ''Fevre Dream'' with another horror novel, ''The Armageddon Rag''. The unexpected commercial failure of ''[[The Armageddon Rag]]'' (1984), "essentially destroyed my career as a novelist at the time", he recalled. However, that failure led him to seek a career in television<ref name="berwick20120601">{{cite news | url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/bd1e2638-a8b7-11e1-a747-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1wYzURCl0 | title=Lunch with the FT: George RR Martin | work=Financial Times | date=June 1, 2012 | accessdate=June 1, 2012 | author=Berwick, Isabel}}</ref> after a Hollywood option on that novel led to him being hired, first as a staff writer and then as an Executive Story Consultant, for the revival of the ''[[The Twilight Zone (1985 TV series)|Twilight Zone]]''. After the [[CBS]] series was cancelled, Martin migrated over to the already-underway satirical science fiction series [[Max Headroom (TV series)|''Max Headroom'']]. He worked on scripts and created the show's "Ped Xing" character. However, before his scripts could go into production, the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] show was cancelled in the middle of its second season. Martin was then hired as a writer-producer on the new dramatic fantasy series ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1987 TV series)|Beauty and the Beast]]''; in 1989, he became the show's co-supervising producer and wrote 14 of its episodes.<ref name="IMDB">{{cite web | url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0552333/?ref_=ttfc_fc_wr4 | title='Profile' George R.R.

In 1987, Martin published a collection of short horror stories in ''Portraits of His Children''. During this same period, Martin continued working in print media as a book-series editor, this time overseeing the development of the multi-author ''[[Wild Cards]]'' book series, which takes place in a [[shared universe]] in which a small slice of post–[[World War II]] humanity gains superpowers after the release of an alien-engineered virus; new titles are still being published in the ongoing series from [[Tor Books]]. In ''Second Person'', Martin "gives a personal account of the close-knit [[role-playing game]] (RPG) culture that gave rise to his ''Wild Cards'' shared-world anthologies".<ref>{{cite journal|author=Kerr, John Finlay |date=2009|title=Second person: Role-playing and story in games and playable media|editors=Harrigan, Pat & Wardrip-Fruin, Noah [book review]|work=Transformative Works and Cultures|number= 2 |DOI=10.3983/twc.2009.0095}}</ref> An important element in the creation of the multiple author series was a campaign of [[Chaosium]]'s role-playing game ''[[Superworld]]'' (1983) that Martin ran in [[Albuquerque]].<ref name="designers">{{Cite book|author=Shannon Appelcline|title=Designers & Dragons|publisher=Mongoose Publishing|year=2011| isbn= 978-1-907702-58-7|pages=87}}</ref> Admitting he became completely obsessed with the game, he stopped writing literature for about a year, but his shrinking bank accounts made him realize he had to come up with something, and got the idea that perhaps the stories and characters created in ''Superworld'' could somehow become profitable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tor.com/2011/06/06/1-the-first-wild-cards-day-or-the-game-that-ate-my-life/|title=The First Wild Cards Day or, the Game That Ate My Life|date=June 6, 2011|publisher=}}</ref> Martin's own contributions to ''Wild Cards'' have included Thomas Tudbury, "[[The Great and Powerful Turtle]]", a powerful [[psychokinetic]] whose flying "shell" consisted of an armored [[VW Beetle]]. As of June 2011, 21 ''Wild Cards'' volumes had been published in the series; earlier that same year, Martin signed the contract for the 22nd volume, ''Low Ball'' (2014), published by [[Tor Books]]. In early 2012, Martin signed another Tor contract for the 23rd ''Wild Cards'' volume, ''High Stakes,'' which was released in August 2016.<ref name="HighStakes">{{cite web|title=High Stakes|url=http://us.macmillan.com/books/9780765335623|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]]|accessdate=July 11, 2016}}</ref>

Martin's novella ''[[Nightflyers]]'' (1980) was adapted into a 1987 feature film of the same name. He was unhappy about having to cut plot elements for the screenplay's scenario in order to accommodate the film's small budget.<ref name="NPR2012">{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/2012/09/15/161142894/thrones-author-george-r-r-martin-plays-not-my-job?ps=view&ec=mostpopular | title='Thrones' Author George R.R.

In 1991, Martin briefly returned to writing novels.

Titled ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', it ran weekly for ten episodes, each approximately an hour long.<ref>[http://www.thrfeed.com/2010/03/hbo-greenlights-game-of-thrones.html HBO greenlights ''Game of Thrones'' to series (pic)], ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', November 30, 2010</ref> Although busy completing ''A Dance With Dragons'' and other projects, George R. R. Martin was heavily involved in the production of the television series adaptation of his books. Martin's involvement included the selection of a production team and participation in scriptwriting; the opening credits list him as a co-executive producer of the series. The series was renewed shortly after the first episode aired.

The first season was nominated for 13 [[Emmy Awards]], ultimately winning two: one for its opening title credits, and one for [[Peter Dinklage]] as Best Supporting Actor.

The first season was also nominated for a 2012 Hugo Award, fantasy and science fiction's oldest award, presented by the [[World Science Fiction Society]] each year at the annual [[World Science Fiction Convention|Worldcon]]; the show went on to win the 2012 Hugo for ''Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form'', at [[Chicon 7]], the [[70th World Science Fiction Convention]], in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]]. Martin took home one of the three Hugo Award trophies awarded in that collaborative category, the other two going to ''Game of Thrones'' showrunners [[David Benioff]] and [[D.B. Weiss|D. B. Weiss]].

The second season, based on the second ''A Song of'' ''Ice and Fire'' novel ''[[A Clash of Kings]]'', began airing on HBO in the US on April 1, 2012. The second season was nominated for 12 Emmy Awards, including another Supporting Actor nomination for Dinklage. It went on to win six of those Emmys in the Technical Arts categories, which were awarded the week before the regular televised 2012 awards show. The second-season episode "[[Blackwater (Game of Thrones)|Blackwater]]", written by George R.R. Martin, was nominated the following year for the 2013 Hugo Award in the ''Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form'' category; that episode went on to win the Hugo Award at LoneStarCon 3, the [[71st World Science Fiction Convention]], in [[San Antonio, Texas]]. In addition to Martin, showrunners Benioff and Weiss (who contributed several scenes to the final screenplay) and episode director Neil Marshal (who expanded the scope of the episode on set) received Hugo statuettes.

Seasons 5 and 6 each won a dozen [[Emmy Awards]], including Outstanding Drama Series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/game-of-thrones-hbo-marathon-year-end-1201946918/ |title=‘Game of Thrones’: Year-End Marathon to Air on HBO |last=Yee |first=Lawrence |date=December 21, 2016 |website=Variety |publisher=Variety |access-date=December 21, 2016 |quote=It has been nominated for the Emmy for Outstanding Drama every season it’s aired, winning the award the last two years.

Martin's work has been described as having "complex story lines, fascinating characters, great dialogue, perfect pacing" by literary critic [[Jeff VanderMeer]].<ref>{{cite news|last=VanderMeer|first=Jeff|title=Book review: 'A Dance With Dragons' by George R.R.

This story has a strong sense of [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]]. His characters are often unhappy or, at least, unsatisfied, in many cases holding on to [[idealism]]s in spite of an otherwise chaotic and ruthless world, and often troubled by their own self-seeking or violent actions, even as they undertake them. Many have elements of [[tragic hero]]es or [[antihero]]es in them; reviewer T. M. Wagner writes: "Let it never be said Martin doesn't share Shakespeare's fondness for the senselessly tragic."<ref name="TMWagner">{{cite web |url= http://www.sfreviews.net/stormofswords.html |title=A Storm of Swords / George R.

}}</ref> However, for many fans, it is precisely this level of "realness" and "completeness"–including many characters' imperfections, moral and ethical ambiguity, and (often sudden) [[Peripeteia|consequential plot twists–]]<nowiki/>that is endearing about Martin's work. Many find that this is what makes the series' story arcs compelling enough to keep following despite its sheer brutality and intricately messy and interwoven plotlines; as TM Wagner points out: <blockquote>There's great tragedy here, but there's also excitement, humor, heroism even in weaklings, nobility even in villains, and, now and then, a taste of justice after all. It's a rare gift when a writer can invest his story with that much humanity.<ref name="TMWagner" /></blockquote>Martin's characters are multifaceted, each with intricate pasts, aspirations, and ambitions. ''Publishers Weekly'' writes of his ongoing epic fantasy ''A Song of Ice and Fire'': "The complexity of characters such as [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]], [[Arya Stark|Arya]] and [[Jaime Lannister|the Kingslayer]] will keep readers turning even the vast number of pages contained in this volume, for the author, like [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] or [[Robert Jordan|Jordan]], makes us care about their fates."<ref>[http://reviews.publishersweekly.com/bd.aspx?isbn=0553106635&pub=pw Review of ''A Storm of Swords'']{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} by Publishers Weekly</ref> Misfortune, injury, and death (including false death and reanimation) often befall major or minor characters, no matter how attached the reader has become. Martin has described his penchant for killing off important characters as being necessary for the story's depth: "when my characters are in danger, I want you to be afraid to turn the page, (so) you need to show right from the beginning that you're playing for keeps".<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.qbd.com.au/author/george-r-r-martin/ |title=George R R Martin |work=QBD The Bookshop |year=2014 |accessdate=July 8, 2014}}</ref>

In distinguishing his work from others, Martin makes a point of emphasizing realism and plausible social dynamics above an over-reliance on magic and a simplistic "[[good and evil|good versus evil]]" dichotomy, which contemporary fantasy writing is often criticized for. Notably, Martin's work makes a sharp departure from the prevalent "heroic knights and chivalry" schema that has become a mainstay in fantasy as derived from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' series of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]. He specifically critiques the oversimplification of Tolkien's themes and devices by imitators in ways that he has humorously described as "Disneyland Middle Ages",<ref>{{cite news| url=http://entertainment.time.com/2011/04/18/grrm-interview-part-2-fantasy-and-history/ | work=Time | date=April 18, 2011 | title=GRRM Interview Part 2: Fantasy and History}}</ref> which gloss over or even ignore major differences between medieval and modern societies, particularly social structures, ways of living, and political arrangements. Martin has been described as "the American Tolkien" by literary critics.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://spectator.org/blog/53929/george-rr-martin-%E2%80%9Camerican-tolkien |title=Is George R.R.

The author makes a point of grounding his work on a foundation of [[historical fiction]], which he channels to evoke important social and political elements of primarily the [[Medieval Europe|European medieval era]] that differ markedly from elements of modern times, including the multigenerational, rigid, and often brutally consequential nature of the hierarchical [[class system]] of [[feudalism|feudal societies]]<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.pri.org/stories/2011-09-21/john-hodgman-interviews-george-rr-martin |title=John Hodgman interviews George R.R.

Even as ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' is a fantasy series that employs magic and the surreal as central to the genre, Martin is keen to ensure that magic is merely one element of many that moves his work forward,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.vulture.com/2011/10/george_rr_martin_on_his_favori.html |title=George R.R.

===Fan criticism and response===
Martin has been criticized by some of his readers for the long periods between books in the ''Ice and Fire'' series, notably the six-year gap between the fourth volume, ''A Feast for Crows'' (2005), and the fifth volume, ''A Dance with Dragons'' (2011).<ref>{{Cite web | last = Miller | first = Laura | title = Onward and Upward with the Arts: Just Write It!: A fantasy author and his impatient fans. |work=The New Yorker | date = April 11, 2011 | url = http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/04/11/110411fa_fact_miller | accessdate = February 12, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | last = Kay | first = Guy Gavriel | title = Restless readers go bonkers |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada | date = April 10, 2009 | url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/article8003.ece | accessdate = May 13, 2010}}</ref> The previous year, in 2010, Martin had responded to fan criticisms by saying he was unwilling to write only his ''Ice and Fire'' series, noting that working on other prose and compiling and editing different book projects have always been part of his working process.<ref>{{Cite news | last = Flood | first = Alison | title = Excitement as George RR Martin announces he's 1,200 pages into new book |work = The Guardian | date = February 16, 2010 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/16/george-rr-martin-new-book | accessdate = May 13, 2010 | location=London}}</ref> Writer [[Neil Gaiman]] famously wrote on his blog in 2009 to a critic of Martin's pace, "George R.
