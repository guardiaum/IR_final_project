'''Douglas Noel Adams''' (11 March 1952 – 11 May 2001) was an English [[author]], [[scriptwriter]], [[essayist]], [[List of humorists|humorist]], [[satirist]] and [[dramatist]].

Adams is best known as the author of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', which originated in 1978 as a BBC [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (radio series)|radio comedy]] before developing into a "trilogy" of five books that sold more than 15&nbsp;million copies in his lifetime and generated a [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series)|television series]], several stage plays, comics, a [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (computer game)|computer game]], and in 2005 a [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film)|feature film]]. Adams's contribution to UK radio is commemorated in [[Radio Academy|The Radio Academy]]'s Hall of Fame.<ref name="radioacad">{{cite web|title=The Radio Academy Hall of Fame |url=http://www.radioacademy.org/hall-of-fame |work=The Radio Academy |accessdate=8 December 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63mNGrql2?url=http://www.radioacademy.org/hall-of-fame/ |archivedate= 8 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}</ref>

Adams also wrote ''[[Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency]]'' (1987) and ''[[The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul]]'' (1988), and co-wrote ''[[The Meaning of Liff]]'' (1983), ''[[The Deeper Meaning of Liff]]'' (1990), ''[[Last Chance to See]]'' (1990), and three stories for the television series ''[[Doctor Who]]''; he also served as [[script editor]] for the show's seventeenth season in 1979. A posthumous collection of his works, including an unfinished novel, was published as ''[[The Salmon of Doubt]]'' in 2002.

Adams was known as an advocate for environmentalism and [[conservation movement|conservation]], as a lover of fast cars, cameras, [[technological innovation]] and the [[Apple Macintosh]], and as a "devout [[atheist]]".

==Early life==
<!-- Please leave this section heading as is, for the chronology of events. Adams's own family (wife and daughter) are discussed later. -->
Adams was born on 11 March 1952 to Janet (née Donovan; 1927–2016) and Christopher Douglas Adams (1927–1985) in [[Cambridge]], England.<ref name=ODNB >Webb 2005b</ref> The family moved to the [[East End of London]] a few months after his birth, where his sister, Susan, was born three years later.<ref name=Adams_xix>{{Harvnb|Adams|2002|pp=xix}}</ref> His parents divorced in 1957; Douglas, Susan, and their mother moved to an [[RSPCA]] animal shelter in [[Brentwood, Essex]], run by his maternal grandparents.<ref>Webb 2005a, p. 32.</ref>

===Education===
Adams attended Primrose Hill Primary School in [[Brentwood, Essex|Brentwood]]. At nine, he passed the entrance exam for [[Brentwood School (Essex)|Brentwood School]], an independent school whose alumni include [[Robin Day]], [[Jack Straw]], [[Noel Edmonds]], and [[David Irving]]. [[Griff Rhys Jones]] was a year below him, and he was in the same class as [[Stuckism|Stuckist]] artist [[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]]. He attended the [[Preparatory school (UK)|prep school]] from 1959 to 1964, then the main school until December 1970. Adams was six feet tall (1.83&nbsp;m) by age 12 and stopped growing at 6&nbsp;ft 5&nbsp;in (1.96&nbsp;m). His form master, Frank Halford, said his height had made him stand out and that he had been self-conscious about it.<ref name=Adams_7>{{Harvnb|Adams|2002|pp=7}}</ref><ref>Botti, Nicholas.

(Click on link at bottom for facsimile page from ''Daily News'' article, 7 March 1998.)</ref> His ability to write stories made him well known in the school.<ref name=Simpson_9>{{Harvnb|Simpson|2003|pp=9}}</ref> He became the only student ever to be awarded a ten out of ten by Halford for creative writing, something he remembered for the rest of his life, particularly when facing [[writer's block]].<ref name=Adams_xix />

Some of his earliest writing was published at the school, such as a report on its photography club in ''The Brentwoodian'' in 1962, or spoof reviews in the school magazine ''Broadsheet'', edited by [[Paul Neil Milne Johnstone]], who later became a character in ''The Hitchhiker's Guide''. He also designed the cover of one issue of the ''Broadsheet'', and had a letter and short story published in ''[[Eagle (comic)|The Eagle]]'', the boys' comic, in 1965. A poem entitled "A Dissertation on the task of writing a poem on a candle and an account of some of the difficulties thereto pertaining" written by Adams in January 1970, at the age of 17, was discovered in a cupboard at the school in early 2014.<ref>Flood, Alison (March 2014). [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/19/lost-school-poems-douglas-adams-griff-rhys-jones "Lost poems of Douglas Adams and Griff Rhys Jones found in school cupboard"], ''The Guardian'', 19 March 2014. Accessed 2 July 2014</ref>

On the strength of a bravura essay on religious poetry that discussed [[the Beatles]] and [[William Blake]], he was awarded an [[Exhibition (scholarship)|Exhibition]] in English at [[St John's College, Cambridge]], going up in 1971. He wanted to join the [[Footlights]], an invitation-only student comedy club that has acted as a hothouse for comic talent. He was not elected immediately as he had hoped, and started to write and perform in revues with Will Adams (no relation) and Martin Smith, forming a group called "Adams-Smith-Adams", but became a member of the Footlights by 1973.<ref name="Simpson_30-40">{{Harvnb|Simpson|2003|pp=30–40}}</ref> Despite doing very little work—he recalled having completed three essays in three years—he graduated in 1974 with a B.A. in [[English literature]].<ref name=ODNB/>

==Career==

===Writing===
After leaving university Adams moved back to London, determined to break into TV and radio as a writer. An edited version of the ''Footlights Revue'' appeared on [[BBC Two|BBC2]] television in 1974. A version of the Revue performed live in London's [[West End of London|West End]] led to Adams being discovered by [[Monty Python]]'s [[Graham Chapman]]. The two formed a brief writing partnership, earning Adams a writing credit in [[List of Monty Python's Flying Circus episodes#6. Party Political Broadcast|episode 45]] of ''Monty Python'' for a sketch called "[[Patient Abuse]]". The pair also co-wrote the "Marilyn Monroe" sketch which appeared on the soundtrack album of ''[[The Album of the Soundtrack of the Trailer of the Film of Monty Python and the Holy Grail|Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]''. Adams is one of only two people other than the original Python members to get a writing credit (the other being [[Neil Innes]]).<ref name=times>{{cite news|title=Terry Jones remembers Douglas Adams, 'the last of the Pythons'|newspaper=The Times|date=10 October 2009}}</ref>

[[File:DNA in Monty Python.jpg|thumb|Adams in his first ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus|Monty Python]]'' appearance, in full surgeon's garb]]

Adams had two brief appearances in the fourth series of ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]''. At the beginning of episode 42, "The Light Entertainment War", Adams is in a surgeon's mask (as Dr. Emile Koning, according to on-screen captions), pulling on gloves, while [[Michael Palin]] narrates a sketch that introduces one person after another but never gets started. At the beginning of episode 44, "Mr. Neutron", Adams is dressed in a [[List of recurring Monty Python's Flying Circus characters#Pepperpots|pepper-pot]] outfit and loads a missile onto a cart driven by [[Terry Jones]], who is calling for scrap metal ("Any old iron..."). The two episodes were broadcast in November 1974. Adams and Chapman also attempted non-Python projects, including ''[[Out of the Trees]]''.

At this point Adams's career stalled; his writing style was unsuited to the then-current style of radio and TV comedy.<ref name=ODNB /> To make ends meet he took a series of odd jobs, including as a hospital porter, barn builder, and chicken shed cleaner. He was employed as a bodyguard by a Qatari family, who had made their fortune in oil.<ref>Webb 2005a, p. 93.</ref>

During this time Adams continued to write and submit sketches, though few were accepted. In 1976 his career had a brief improvement when he wrote and performed ''Unpleasantness at Brodie's Close'' at the [[Edinburgh Fringe]] festival. By Christmas, work had dried up again, and a depressed Adams moved to live with his mother.<ref name=ODNB /> The lack of writing work hit him hard and low confidence became a feature of Adams's life; "I have terrible periods of lack of confidence [..] I briefly did therapy, but after a while I realised it was like a farmer complaining about the weather. You can't fix the weather&nbsp;– you just have to get on with it".<ref name=Adams_prologue>{{Harvnb|Adams|2002|pp=prologue}}</ref>

Some of Adams's early radio work included sketches for ''[[The Burkiss Way]]'' in 1977 and ''[[The News Huddlines]]''.<ref>''Hitchhiker: A Biography of Douglas Adams'' by M. J. Simpson, p87</ref> He also wrote, again with Chapman, 20 February 1977 episode of ''Doctor on the Go'', a sequel to the ''[[Doctor in the House (TV series)|Doctor in the House]]'' television comedy series. After the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (radio series)|first radio series of ''The Hitchhiker's Guide'']] became successful, Adams was made a BBC radio producer, working on ''[[Week Ending]]'' and a pantomime called ''[[Black Cinderella Two Goes East]]''.<ref>Roberts, Jem. ''The Clue Bible: The Fully Authorised History of I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue from Footlights to Mornington Crescent'': London, 2009, p164-5</ref> He left  after six months to become the script editor for ''[[Doctor Who]]''.

In 1979 Adams and [[John Lloyd (producer)|John Lloyd]] wrote scripts for two half-hour episodes of ''[[Doctor Snuggles]]'': "The Remarkable Fidgety River" and "The Great Disappearing Mystery" (episodes seven and twelve). John Lloyd was also co-author of two episodes from the original ''Hitchhiker'' radio series ("Fit the Fifth" and "Fit the Sixth", also known as "Episode Five" and "Episode Six"), as well as ''[[The Meaning of Liff]]'' and ''[[The Deeper Meaning of Liff]]''.

====''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy''====
{{Main article|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy}}
''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' was a concept for a science-fiction comedy radio series pitched by Adams and radio producer [[Simon Brett]] to [[BBC Radio 4]] in 1977. Adams came up with an outline for a pilot episode, as well as a few other stories (reprinted in [[Neil Gaiman]]'s book ''[[Don't Panic: The Official Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Companion]]'') that could potentially be used in the series.
[[File:Towelday-Innsbruck.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Towel Day]] 2005 in Innsbruck, Austria, where Adams first had the idea of ''The Hitchhiker's Guide''. In the novels a towel is the most useful thing a space traveller can have.  The annual Towel Day (25 May) was first celebrated in 2001, two weeks after Adams's death.]]

According to Adams, the idea for the title occurred to him while he lay drunk in a field in [[Innsbruck]], Austria, gazing at the stars. He was carrying a copy of the ''[[Hitch-hiker's Guide to Europe]]'', and it occurred to him that "somebody ought to write a ''Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy''". He later said that the constant repetition of this anecdote had obliterated his memory of the actual event.<ref>{{cite book | author=Adams, Douglas| editor= Geoffrey Perkins (ed.), Additional Material by M. J. Simpson|title=[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: The Original Radio Scripts]] | page = 10 | edition =25th Anniversary | publisher=Pan Books | year=2003 | isbn=0-330-41957-9}}</ref>

Despite the original outline, Adams was said to make up the stories as he wrote. He turned to [[John Lloyd (producer)|John Lloyd]] for help with the final two episodes of [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#The Primary Phase|the first series]]. Lloyd contributed bits from an unpublished science fiction book of his own, called ''GiGax''.<ref>Webb 2005a, p. 120.</ref> Very little of Lloyd's material survived in later adaptations of ''Hitchhiker's'', such as the novels and the TV series. The TV series was based on the first six radio episodes, and sections contributed by Lloyd were largely re-written.

[[BBC Radio 4]] broadcast the first radio series weekly in the UK in March and April 1978. The series was distributed in the United States by [[National Public Radio]].  Following the success of the first series, another episode was recorded and broadcast, which was commonly known as the Christmas Episode. [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#The Secondary Phase|A second series]] of five episodes was broadcast one per night, during the week of 21–25 January 1980.

While working on the radio series (and with simultaneous projects such as ''[[The Pirate Planet]]'') Adams developed problems keeping to writing deadlines that got worse as he published novels. Adams was never a prolific writer and usually had to be forced by others to do any writing. This included being locked in a hotel suite with his editor for three weeks to ensure that ''[[So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish]]'' was completed.<ref>Felch 2004</ref> He was quoted as saying, "I love deadlines. I love the whooshing noise they make as they go by."<ref name=Simpson_236>{{Harvnb|Simpson|2003|pp=236}}</ref> Despite the difficulty with deadlines, Adams wrote five novels in the series, published in 1979, 1980, 1982, 1984, and 1992.

The books formed the basis for other adaptations, such as three-part comic book adaptations for each of the first three books, an interactive text-adventure [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (computer game)|computer game]], and a photo-illustrated edition, published in 1994. This latter edition featured a [[42 Puzzle]] designed by Adams, which was later incorporated into paperback covers of the first four ''Hitchhiker's'' novels (the paperback for the fifth re-used the artwork from the hardback edition).<ref>[http://www.iblist.com/series.php?id=2 Internet Book List] page, with links to all five novels, and reproductions of the 1990s paperback covers that included the [[42 Puzzle]].</ref>

In 1980 Adams began attempts to turn the first ''Hitchhiker's'' novel into a film, making several trips to Los Angeles, and working with Hollywood studios and potential producers. The next year, the radio series became the basis for a BBC television mini-series<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081874/|title=''The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy''|publisher=Internet Movie Database}}</ref> broadcast in six parts. When he died in 2001 in California, he had been trying again to get the movie project started with [[Disney]], which had bought the rights in 1998. The screenplay got a posthumous re-write by [[Karey Kirkpatrick]], and [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film)|the resulting film]] was released in 2005.

Radio producer [[Dirk Maggs]] had consulted with Adams, first in 1993, and later in 1997 and 2000 about creating a third radio series, based on the third novel in the ''Hitchhiker's'' series.<ref>{{cite book | author=Adams, Douglas. | editor = [[Dirk Maggs]], dramatisations and editor | title=The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Radio Scripts: The Tertiary, Quandary and Quintessential Phases | publisher=Pan Books | year=2005|isbn=0-330-43510-8 |pages=xiv | nopp=true}}</ref> They also discussed the possibilities of radio adaptations of the final two novels in the five-book "trilogy". As with the movie, this project was realised only after Adams's death. The third series, ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#The Tertiary Phase|The Tertiary Phase]]'', was broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]] in September 2004 and was subsequently released on audio CD. With the aid of a recording of his reading of ''Life, the Universe and Everything'' and editing, Adams can be heard playing the part of Agrajag posthumously. ''So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish'' and ''Mostly Harmless'' made up the fourth and fifth radio series, respectively (on radio they were titled ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#The Quandary Phase|The Quandary Phase]]'' and ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#The Quintessential Phase|The Quintessential Phase]]'') and these were broadcast in May and June 2005, and also subsequently released on Audio CD. The last episode in the last series (with a new, "more upbeat" ending) concluded with, "The very final episode of ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' by Douglas Adams is affectionately dedicated to its author."<ref>Adams, ''Dirk Maggs'', Page 356.</ref>

====''Dirk Gently'' series====
[[File:Douglas Adams San Francisco.jpg|thumb|Adams in March 2000]]
Between Adams's first trip to Madagascar with [[Mark Carwardine]] in 1985, and their series of travels that formed the basis for the radio series and non-fiction book ''[[Last Chance to See]]'', Adams wrote two other novels with a new cast of characters. ''[[Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency]]'' was published in 1987, and was described by its author as "a kind of ghost-horror-detective-time-travel-romantic-comedy-epic, mainly concerned with mud, music and quantum mechanics".<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Neil Gaiman|Gaiman, Neil]] | title=Don't Panic: Douglas Adams & The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy | edition=Second U.S. | publisher=Titan Books | year=2003 | page=169 | isbn=1-84023-742-2}}</ref> It was derived from two Doctor Who serials Adams had written.

A sequel, ''[[The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul]]'', was published a year later. This was an entirely original work, Adams's first since ''So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish.'' After the book tour, Adams set off on his round-the-world excursion which supplied him with the material for ''Last Chance to See''.

====''Doctor Who''====
{{Main article|Doctor Who}}
Adams sent the script for the ''HHGG'' pilot radio programme to the ''Doctor Who'' production office in 1978, and was commissioned to write ''[[The Pirate Planet]]'' (see below). He had also previously attempted to submit a potential movie script, called "Doctor Who and the Krikkitmen", which later became his novel ''Life, the Universe and Everything'' (which in turn became the third ''Hitchhiker's Guide'' radio series). Adams then went on to serve as script editor on the show for its seventeenth season in 1979. Altogether, he wrote three [[List of Doctor Who serials|''Doctor Who'' serials]] starring [[Tom Baker]] as [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]]:
* "[[The Pirate Planet]]" (the second serial in the "[[The Key to Time|Key to Time]]" arc, in [[Doctor Who (season 16)|season 16]])
* "[[City of Death]]" (with producer [[Graham Williams (television producer)|Graham Williams]], from an original storyline by writer [[David Fisher (writer)|David Fisher]]. It was transmitted under the pseudonym "[[David Agnew]]")
* "[[Shada (Doctor Who)|Shada]]" (only partially filmed; not televised due to [[strike action|industry disputes]])

The episodes authored by Adams are some of the few that were not novelised as Adams would not allow anyone else to write them, and asked for a higher price than the publishers were willing to pay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skepticfiles.org/en001/drwhogde.htm |title=A 1990s Doctor Who FAQ |publisher=Skepticfiles.org |accessdate=11 March 2013}}</ref> "Shada" was later adapted as a novel by [[Gareth Roberts (writer)|Gareth Roberts]] in 2012 and "City of Death" and "The Pirate Planet" by [[James Goss (producer)|James Goss]] in 2015 and 2017 respectively.

Elements of ''Shada'' and ''City of Death'' were reused in Adams's later novel ''[[Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency]]'', in particular the character of [[Professor Chronotis]]. [[Big Finish Productions]] eventually remade ''Shada'' as an audio play starring [[Paul McGann]] as the Doctor. Accompanied by partially animated illustrations, it was [[Doctor Who spin-offs#Webcasts|webcast]] on the [[BBC Online|BBC website]] in 2003, and subsequently released as a two-CD set later that year. An omnibus edition of this version was broadcast on the digital radio station [[BBC7]] on 10 December 2005.

In the ''Doctor Who'' 2012 Christmas episode ''[[The Snowmen#Production|The Snowmen]]'', writer [[Steven Moffat]] was inspired by a storyline that Adams pitched called ''The Doctor Retires''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Moffat |first=Steven |url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-12-24/doctor-who-christmas-special-steven-moffat-matt-smith-and-jenna-louise-coleman-reveal-all |title=Doctor Who Christmas special: Steven Moffat, Matt Smith and Jenna-Louise Coleman reveal all |work=Radio Times |date=24 December 2012 |accessdate=8 July 2013}}</ref>

===Music===
Adams played the guitar left-handed and had a collection of twenty-four left-handed guitars when he died (having received his first guitar in 1964). He also studied piano in the 1960s with the same teacher as [[Paul Wickens]], the pianist who plays in [[Paul McCartney]]'s band (and composed the music for the 2004–2005 editions of the ''Hitchhiker's Guide'' radio series).<ref>Webb, page 49.</ref> [[Pink Floyd]] and [[Procol Harum]] had important influence on Adams's work.

====Pink Floyd====

Adams's official biography shares its name with the song "[[Wish You Were Here (1975 song)|Wish You Were Here]]" by Pink Floyd. Adams was friends with Pink Floyd guitarist [[David Gilmour]] and, on Adams's 42nd birthday, he was invited to make a guest appearance at Pink Floyd's concert of 28 October 1994 at Earls Court in London, playing guitar on the songs "[[Brain Damage (song)|Brain Damage]]" and "[[Eclipse (song)|Eclipse]]".<ref name="Mabbett-MM">{{Cite book |publisher= Omnibus Press |isbn= 978-1-84938-370-7 |last= Mabbett |first= Andy |title= Pink Floyd – The Music and the Mystery |location= London |year= 2010 }}</ref> Adams chose the name for Pink Floyd's 1994 album, ''[[The Division Bell]]'', by picking the words from the lyrics to one of its tracks, "High Hopes".<ref name="Mabbett-MM" /> Gilmour also performed at Adams's memorial service in 2001, and what would have been Adams's 60th birthday party in 2012.

===Computer games and projects===
Douglas Adams created an [[interactive fiction]] version of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (computer game)|HHGG]]'' with [[Steve Meretzky]] from [[Infocom]] in 1984. In 1986 he participated in a week-long brainstorming session with the [[Lucasfilm Games]] team for the game ''[[Labyrinth: The Computer Game|Labyrinth]]''. Later he was also involved in creating ''[[Bureaucracy (computer game)|Bureaucracy]]'' as a parody of events in his own life.

Adams was a founder-director and Chief Fantasist of [[The Digital Village]], a digital media and Internet company with which he created ''[[Starship Titanic]]'', a [[Codie]] Award-winning and [[BAFTA#Games Awards|BAFTA-nominated adventure game]], which was published in 1998 by [[Simon & Schuster]].<ref name="bbc.co.uk">BBC Online (no date) [http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/hitchhikers/dna/biog.shtml "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: DNA (1952-2001)"] Accessed 9 July 2014</ref><ref>Botti, Nicolas (2009).

In April 1999, Adams initiated the [[h2g2]] [[collaborative writing]] project, an experimental attempt at making ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' a reality, and at harnessing the collective brainpower of the internet community. It was hosted by BBC Online from 2001 to 2011.<ref name="bbc.co.uk"/>

In 1990 Adams wrote and presented a television documentary programme ''[[Hyperland]]''<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0188677/ Internet Movie Database's page for ''Hyperland'']</ref> which featured [[Tom Baker]] as a "software agent" (similar to the assistant pictured in Apple's [[Knowledge Navigator]] video of future concepts from 1987), and interviews with [[Ted Nelson]], the co-inventor of [[hypertext]] and the person who coined the term. Adams was an [[early adopter]] and advocate of hypertext.

==Personal beliefs and activism==

===Atheism and views on religion===
Adams described himself as a "radical [[atheist]]", adding "radical" for emphasis so he would not be asked if he meant agnostic. He told [[American Atheists]] that this conveyed the fact that he really meant it. He imagined a sentient puddle who wakes up one morning and thinks, "This is an interesting world I find myself in – an interesting hole I find myself in – fits me rather neatly, doesn't it? In fact it fits me staggeringly well, must have been made to have me in it!" to demonstrate his view that the [[fine-tuned Universe]] argument for God was a fallacy.<ref>Adams 1998.</ref>

He remained fascinated by religion because of its effect on human affairs. "I love to keep poking and prodding at it. I've thought about it so much over the years that that fascination is bound to spill over into my writing."<ref name=amath>{{cite journal|last=Silverman |first=Dave |title=Interview: Douglas Adams |journal=American Atheist |year=1998–1999 |volume=37 |issue=1 |url=http://www.atheists.org/Interview%3A__Douglas_Adams |accessdate=16 August 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63mRFcWVO?url=http://www.atheists.org/Interview%3A__Douglas_Adams |archivedate=8 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}</ref>

The evolutionary biologist and atheist [[Richard Dawkins]] uses Adams's influence throughout to exemplify arguments for non-belief in his 2006 book ''[[The God Delusion]]''. Dawkins dedicated the book to Adams, whom he jokingly called "possibly [my] only convert" to atheism<ref name="TheGuardian">{{cite news|url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/roundupstory/0,,1939704,00.html |title=Observer, '&#39;The God Delusion'&#39;, 5&nbsp;November 2006|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=5 November 2006 |accessdate=1 June 2009 | location=London | first=Kim | last=Bunce}}</ref> and wrote on his death that "Science has lost a friend, literature has lost a luminary, the [[mountain gorilla]] and the [[black rhino]] have lost a gallant defender."<ref name=Dawkins2001>{{cite news|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|title=Lament for Douglas Adams|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/may/14/books.booksnews|accessdate=29 December 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=13 May 2001}}</ref>

===Environmental activism===
Adams was also an [[environmental activist]] who campaigned on behalf of [[endangered species]]. This activism included the production of the non-fiction radio series ''[[Last Chance to See]]'', in which he and [[natural history|naturalist]] [[Mark Carwardine]] visited rare species such as the [[kakapo]] and [[Chinese river dolphin|baiji]], and the publication of a tie-in book of the same name. In 1992 this was made into a CD-ROM combination of [[audiobook]], [[e-book]] and picture slide show.

Adams and Mark Carwardine contributed the 'Meeting a Gorilla' passage from ''[[Last Chance to See]]'' to the book ''[[Great Ape Project|The Great Ape Project]]''.<ref>{{cite book | author=[[Paola Cavalieri|Cavalieri, Paola]] and [[Peter Singer]], editors | title=The Great Ape Project: Equality Beyond Humanity | edition=U.S. Paperback | publisher=St. Martin's Griffin | year=1994 | pages=19–23|isbn=0-312-11818-X}}</ref> This book, edited by [[Paola Cavalieri]] and [[Peter Singer]], launched a wider-scale project in 1993, which calls for the extension of moral equality to include all great apes, human and non-human.

In 1994 he participated in a climb of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] while wearing a rhino suit for the British charity organisation ''[[Save the Rhino|Save the Rhino International]]''. Puppeteer [[William Todd-Jones]], who had originally worn the suit in the London Marathon to raise money and bring awareness to the group, also participated in the climb wearing a rhino suit; Adams wore the suit while travelling to the mountain before the climb began. About £100,000 was raised through that event, benefiting schools in Kenya and a [[black rhinoceros]] preservation programme in [[Tanzania]]. Adams was also an active supporter of the ''[[Dian Fossey]] Gorilla Fund''.

Since 2003, ''Save the Rhino'' has held an annual Douglas Adams Memorial Lecture around the time of his birthday to raise money for environmental campaigns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lifednah2g2.blogspot.co.uk/2011/01/ninth-douglas-adams-memorial-lecture.html |title=The Ninth Douglas Adams Memorial Lecture |publisher=Save the Rhino International |accessdate=27 July 2011}}</ref>

===Technology and innovation===
Adams bought his first [[word processor]] in 1982, having considered one as early as 1979. His first purchase was a 'Nexus'. In 1983, when he and Jane Belson went to Los Angeles, he bought a [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[Rainbow 100|Rainbow]]. Upon their return to England, Adams bought an [[Apricot Computers|Apricot]], then a [[BBC Micro]] and a [[Tandy 1000]].<ref name="Simpson_184-185">{{Harvnb|Simpson|2003|pp=184–185}}</ref> In ''[[Last Chance to See]]'' Adams mentions his [[Cambridge Z88]], which he had taken to [[Zaire]] on a quest to find the [[northern white rhinoceros]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Adams, Douglas and [[Mark Carwardine]] | title=Last Chance to See | edition=First U.S. Hardcover | publisher=[[Harmony Books]] | year=1991 | page=59 | isbn=0-517-58215-5}}</ref>

Adams's posthumously published work, ''[[The Salmon of Doubt]]'', features multiple articles by him on the subject of technology, including reprints of articles that originally ran in ''[[MacUser]]'' magazine, and in ''[[The Independent on Sunday]]'' newspaper. In these Adams claims that one of the first computers he ever saw was a [[Commodore PET]], and that he had "adored" his Apple Macintosh ("or rather my family of however many Macintoshes it is that I've recklessly accumulated over the years") since he first saw one at Infocom's offices in Boston in 1984.<ref>{{cite book | author=Adams, Douglas | title=The Salmon of Doubt: Hitchhiking the Galaxy One Last Time | edition=First UK hardcover | publisher=Macmillan | year=2002 | pages=90–1 | isbn=0-333-76657-1}}</ref>

Adams was a Macintosh user from the time they first came out in 1984 until his death in 2001. He was the first person to buy a Mac in Europe (the second being [[Stephen Fry]] – though some accounts differ on this, saying Fry bought his Mac first. Fry claims he was second to Adams<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gx6WPQkhUXI |title=Craig Ferguson 23 February, 2010B Late Late show Stephen Fry PT2 |publisher=YouTube |date=21 June 2010 |accessdate=27 July 2011}}</ref>). Adams was also an "[[AppleMasters|Apple Master]]", celebrities whom Apple made into spokespeople for its products (others included [[John Cleese]] and [[Gregory Hines]]). Adams's contributions included a rock video that he created using the first version of [[iMovie]] with footage featuring his daughter Polly. The video was available on Adams's [[.Mac]] homepage. Adams installed and started using the first release of [[Mac OS X]] in the weeks leading up to his death. His very last post to his own forum was in praise of Mac OS X and the possibilities of its [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]] programming framework. He said it was "awesome...", which was also the last word he wrote on his site.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.douglasadams.com/cgi-bin/mboard/info/dnathread.cgi?2922,1 |title=Adams's final post on his forums at |publisher=Douglasadams.com |accessdate=1 June 2009}}</ref>

Adams used email to correspond with [[Steve Meretzky]] in the early 1980s, during their collaboration on Infocom's version of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (computer game)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''.<ref name="Simpson_184-185"/> While living in New Mexico in 1993 he set up another e-mail address and began posting to his own [[USENET]] newsgroup, alt.fan.douglas-adams, and occasionally, when his computer was acting up, to the comp.sys.mac hierarchy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/group/alt.fan.douglas-adams |title=Discussions – alt.fan.douglas-adams &#124; Google Groups |publisher=Google |accessdate=11 March 2013}}</ref> Challenges to the authenticity of his messages later led Adams to set up a message forum on his own website to avoid the issue. In 1996, Adams was a keynote speaker at the [[Microsoft]] [[Professional Developers Conference]] (PDC) where he described the personal computer as being a modelling device. The video of his keynote speech is archived on [[Channel 9 (discussion forum)|Channel 9]].<ref>{{cite web |last = Adams |first = Douglas |title = PDC 1996 Keynote with Douglas Adams |work=[[channel9.msdn.com]] |publisher=Channel 9 |date = 15 May 2001 |url = http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/PDC/PDC-1996/PDC-1996-Keynote-with-Douglas-Adams |accessdate =22 March 2013}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Adams moved to [[Upper Street]], [[Islington]], in 1981<ref name="IPP" /> and to Duncan Terrace, a few minutes' walk away, in the late 1980s.<ref name="IPP" />

In the early 1980s Adams had an affair with novelist [[Sally Emerson]], who was separated from her husband at that time. Adams later dedicated his book ''[[Life, the Universe and Everything]]'' to Emerson. In 1981 Emerson returned to her husband, [[Peter Stothard]], a contemporary of Adams's at [[Brentwood School (England)|Brentwood School]], and later editor of ''[[The Times]]''. Adams was soon introduced by friends to Jane Belson, with whom he later became romantically involved. Belson was the "lady barrister" mentioned in the jacket-flap biography printed in his books during the mid-1980s ("He [Adams] lives in Islington with a lady barrister and an Apple Macintosh"). The two lived in Los Angeles together during 1983 while Adams worked on an early screenplay adaptation of ''Hitchhiker's''. When the deal fell through, they moved back to London, and after several separations ("He is currently not certain where he lives, or with whom")<ref name=sfweekly>{{cite web|last=Bowers |first=Keith |title=Big Three |url=http://www.sfweekly.com/2011-07-06/calendar/big-three/ |work=SF Weekly |accessdate=8 December 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63mSWp8yr?url=http://www.sfweekly.com/2011-07-06/calendar/big-three/ |archivedate= 8 December 2011 |deadurl=no |date=6 July 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref> and a broken engagement, they married on 25 November 1991. Adams and Belson had one daughter together, Polly Jane Rocket Adams, born on 22 June 1994, shortly after Adams turned 42. In 1999 the family moved from London to [[Santa Barbara, California]], where they lived until his death. Following the funeral, Jane Belson and Polly Adams returned to London.<ref>Webb, Chapter 10.</ref> Jane died on 7 September 2011 of cancer, aged 59.<ref name=timesobit>{{cite web |title=Obituary & Guest Book Preview for Jane Elizabeth BELSON |url=http://announcements.thetimes.co.uk/obituaries/timesonline-uk/obituary.aspx?page=lifestory&pid=153521790 |work=The Times |accessdate=8 December 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63mSoMnJe?url=http://announcements.thetimes.co.uk/obituaries/timesonline-uk/obituary-preview.aspx?n=jane-elizabeth-belson&pid=153521790&referrer=2282 |archivedate=8 December 2011 |deadurl=no |date=9 September 2011 |df= }}</ref><ref name=h2g2obit>{{cite web|title=Jane Belson, Douglas Adams's widow, passed away|url=http://lifednah2g2.blogspot.com/2011/09/jane-belson-douglas-adams-widow-passed.html|work=h2g2|accessdate=9 July 2013}}</ref>

Adams died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on 11 May 2001, aged 49, after resting from his regular workout at a private gym in [[Montecito, California]].

In May 2002 ''[[The Salmon of Doubt]]'' was published, containing many short stories, essays, and letters, as well as eulogies from [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Stephen Fry]] (in the UK edition), [[Christopher Cerf (musician and television producer)|Christopher Cerf]] (in the US edition), and [[Terry Jones]] (in the US paperback edition). It also includes eleven chapters of his unfinished novel, ''The Salmon of Doubt'', which was originally intended to become a new [[Dirk Gently]] novel, but might have later become the sixth ''Hitchhiker'' novel.<ref>

Other events after Adams's death included a [[webcast]] production of ''[[Shada (Doctor Who)|Shada]]'', allowing the complete story to be told, radio dramatisations of the final three books in the ''Hitchhiker's'' series, and the completion of [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film)|the film adaptation]] of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (book)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''. The film, released in 2005, posthumously credits Adams as a producer, and several design elements – including a head-shaped planet seen near the end of the film – incorporated Adams's features.

A 12-part radio series based on the [[Dirk Gently]] novels was announced in 2007, with annual transmissions starting in October.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dirkmaggs.dswilliams.co.uk/Dirk%20Maggs%20News%20%20new%20projects.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021209193312/http://www.dirkmaggs.dswilliams.co.uk/dirk%20maggs%20news%20%20new%20projects.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date= 9 December 2002 |title=Dirk Maggs News and New Projects page |df= }}</ref>

BBC Radio 4 also commissioned a third Dirk Gently radio series based on the incomplete chapters of ''The Salmon of Doubt'', and written by [[Kim Fuller]];<ref>{{cite web|author=Matthew Hemley |url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/24312/douglas-adams-final-dirk-gently-novel-to-be |title=The Stage / News / Douglas Adams's final Dirk Gently novel to be adapted for Radio 4 |work=The Stage |date=5 May 2009 |accessdate=20 August 2009}}</ref> but this was dropped in favour of a BBC TV series based on the two completed novels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2009/10/11/9767/bbc_plans_dirk_gently_tv_series|title=BBC plans Dirk Gently TV series|publisher=Chortle.co.uk|date=11 October 2009|accessdate=11 October 2009}}</ref> A sixth ''Hitchhiker'' novel, ''[[And Another Thing...

A [[BBC Radio 4]] ''[[Book at Bedtime]]'' adaptation and an audio book soon followed.

On 25 May 2001, two weeks after Adams's death, his fans organised a tribute known as [[Towel Day]], which has been observed every year since then.<ref>{{cite news | last=Molloy | first=Mark | date=May 25, 2016 | title=What is Towel Day?
