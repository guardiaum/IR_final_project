''Daniel Gerhard Brown''' (born June 22, 1964) is an American author of [[thriller fiction]], most notably the novels ''[[Angels & Demons]]'' (2000), ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' (2003), and ''[[Inferno (Brown novel)|Inferno]]'' (2013). Brown's novels are treasure hunts set in a 24-hour period,<ref name=Themes>Brown. Witness statement; Pages 17 & 21.</ref> and feature the recurring themes of [[cryptography]], keys, symbols, codes, and [[conspiracy theories]]. His books have been translated into 52 languages, and as of 2012, sold over 200 million copies. Three of them, ''[[Angels & Demons]]'' (2000), ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' (2003), and ''[[Inferno (Dan Brown novel)|Inferno]]'' (2013), have been adapted into films.

Brown's novels that feature the lead character [[Robert Langdon]] also include historical themes and [[Christianity]] as motifs, and as a result, have generated controversy. Brown states on his website that his books are not [[Anti-Christian sentiment|anti-Christian]], though he is on a 'constant spiritual journey' himself, and says that his book ''The Da Vinci Code'' is simply "an entertaining story that promotes spiritual discussion and debate" and suggests that the book may be used "as a positive catalyst for introspection and exploration of our faith".

==Early life==
Dan Gerhard Brown was born on June 22, 1964 in [[Exeter, New Hampshire]]. He has a younger sister, Valerie (born 1968) and brother, Gregory (born 1975). Brown attended Exeter's public schools until the ninth grade.<ref name=LisaRogakBiography>Rogak, Lisa (May 7, 2013).

<blockquote>"I was raised Episcopalian, and I was very religious as a kid. Then, in eighth or ninth grade, I studied astronomy, cosmology, and the origins of the universe. I remember saying to a minister, 'I don't get it. I read a book that said there was an explosion known as the Big Bang, but here it says God created heaven and Earth and the animals in seven days. Which is right?' Unfortunately, the response I got was, 'Nice boys don't ask that question.' A light went off, and I said, 'The Bible doesn't make sense. Science makes much more sense to me.' And I just gravitated away from religion.<ref name=kaplan/></blockquote> 

When asked in the same interview about his then-current religious views, Brown replied:

<blockquote>The irony is that I've really come full circle. The more science I studied, the more I saw that physics becomes metaphysics and numbers become imaginary numbers. The farther you go into science, the mushier the ground gets. You start to say, 'Oh, there is an order and a spiritual aspect to science.'"<ref name=kaplan/></blockquote> 

Brown's interest in secrets and puzzles stems from their presence in his household as a child, where codes and [[cipher]]s were the linchpin tying together the mathematics, music, and languages in which his parents worked. The young Brown spent hours working out [[anagram]]s and [[crossword puzzles]], and he and his siblings participated in elaborate treasure hunts devised by their father on birthdays and holidays. On Christmas, for example, Brown and his siblings did not find gifts under the tree, but followed a treasure map with codes and clues throughout their house and even around town to find the gifts.<ref name=witness>{{cite news|author=Lattman, Peter|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2006/03/14/the-da-vinci-code-authors-witness-statement-is-a-great-read/|title='The Da Vinci Code' Trial: Dan Brown's Witness Statement Is a Great Read|work=Wall Street Journal|date=March 14, 2006|accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref> Brown's relationship with his father inspired that of [[List of The Da Vinci Code characters#Sophie Neveu Saint-Clair|Sophie Neveu]] and [[List of The Da Vinci Code characters#Jacques Saunière|Jacques Saunière]] in ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'', and Chapter 23 of that novel was inspired by one of his childhood treasure hunts.<ref>Brown. Witness statement, p. 36.</ref>

After graduating from Phillips Exeter, Brown attended [[Amherst College]], where he was a member of [[Psi Upsilon]] fraternity. He played [[squash (sport)|squash]], sang in the [[Amherst College Glee Club|Amherst Glee Club]], and was a writing student of visiting novelist [[Alan Lelchuk]]. Brown spent the 1985 school year abroad in [[Seville]], Spain, where he was enrolled in an art history course at the [[University of Seville]].<ref name=witness/> Brown graduated from Amherst in 1986.<ref>[http://www.amherst.edu/aboutamherst/news/campusbuzz/node/512982 "Bestselling authors Dan Brown '86, Charles Mann '76 to speak Thursday"], amherst.edu, September 24, 2013.</ref><ref name="Amherst8.12">[https://www.amherst.edu/media/view/425849/original/Brown%2BDan%2BScholarship%2BFund.pd "Dan Brown '86 Creates Scholarship Fund to Celebrate his 25th Reunion"].

==Career==
===Songwriter and pop singer===
After graduating from Amherst, Brown dabbled with a musical career, creating effects with a synthesizer, and self-producing a children's cassette entitled ''SynthAnimals'', which included a collection of tracks such as "Happy Frogs" and "Suzuki Elephants"; it sold a few hundred copies. He then formed his own record company called Dalliance, and in 1990 self-published a CD entitled ''Perspective'', targeted to the adult market, which also sold a few hundred copies. In 1991 he moved to [[Hollywood]] to pursue a career as singer-songwriter and pianist. To support himself, he taught classes at [[Beverly Hills Preparatory School]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Dan Brown Facts|url=http://www.softschools.com/facts/authors/dan_brown_facts/1415/|website=Softschools.com|accessdate=June 13, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Dan Brown - Book Series In Order|url=http://www.bookseriesinorder.com/dan-brown/|website=Book Series In order|accessdate=June 13, 2015}}</ref>

He also joined the [[National Academy of Songwriters]], and participated in many of its events. It was there that he met Blythe Newlon, a woman 12 years his senior, who was the Academy's Director of Artist Development. Though it was not officially part of her job, she took on the seemingly unusual task of helping to promote Brown's projects; she wrote press releases, set up promotional events, and put him in contact with people who could be helpful to his career. She and Brown also developed a personal relationship, though this was not known to all of their associates until 1993, when Brown moved back to New Hampshire, and it was learned that Newlon would accompany him. They married in 1997, at Pea Porridge Pond, near [[Conway, New Hampshire]].<ref name="Walters-OKeeffe">Walters, Joanna and Alice O'Keeffe.

In 1994 Brown released a CD titled ''Angels & Demons''. Its artwork was the same [[ambigram]] by artist [[John Langdon (typographer)|John Langdon]] which he later used for the novel ''[[Angels & Demons]]''. The liner notes also again credited his wife for her involvement, thanking her "for being my tireless cowriter, coproducer, second engineer, significant other, and therapist". The CD included songs such as "Here in These Fields" and the religious ballad, "All I Believe".<ref>Rogak, Lisa. ''The Man Behind the Da Vinci Code – an Unauthorized Biography of Dan Brown''. Andrews McMeel Publishing, 2005; {{ISBN|0-7407-5642-7}}</ref>
Brown and his wife, Blythe, moved to his home town in New Hampshire in 1993. Brown became an English teacher at his alma mater Phillips Exeter, and gave Spanish classes to 6th, 7th, and 8th graders at [[Lincoln Akerman School]], a small school for K–8th grade with about 250 students, in [[Hampton Falls, New Hampshire|Hampton Falls]]. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Writing ===
{{main|Robert Langdon (book series)}}
While on vacation in [[Tahiti]] in 1993,<ref name=witness/> Brown read [[Sidney Sheldon]]'s novel ''[[The Doomsday Conspiracy]]'', and was inspired to become a writer of thrillers.<ref name=witness/><ref>Sources differ on how Sheldon inspired Brown. He indicates on Page 3 of his witness statement that Sheldon's book was an attention-holding page turner that reminded him how fun it was to read, but the BBC source indicates that he thought he could "do better" than Sheldon.</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Decoding the Da Vinci Code author|date=August 10, 2004|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3541342.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=May 18, 2009}}</ref> He started work on ''[[Digital Fortress]]'', setting much of it in Seville, where he had studied in 1985. He also co-wrote a humor book with his wife, ''187 Men to Avoid: A Survival Guide for the Romantically Frustrated Woman'', under the pseudonym "Danielle Brown". The book's author profile reads, "Danielle Brown currently lives in New England: teaching school, writing books, and avoiding men." The copyright is attributed to Dan Brown.

In 1996 Brown quit teaching to become a full-time writer. ''Digital Fortress'' was published in 1998. His wife, Blythe, did much of the book's promotion, writing press releases, booking Brown on talk shows, and setting up press interviews. A few months later, Brown and his wife released ''The Bald Book'', another humor book. It was officially credited to his wife, though a representative of the publisher said that it was primarily written by Brown. Brown subsequently wrote ''[[Angels & Demons]]'' and ''Deception Point'', released in 2000 and 2001 respectively, the former of which was the first to feature the lead character, Harvard symbology expert [[Robert Langdon]].

Brown's first three novels had little success, with fewer than 10,000 copies in each of their first printings. His fourth novel, ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'', became a bestseller, going to the top of the [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]] during its first week of release in 2003. It is one of the most popular books of all time, with 81 million copies sold worldwide as of 2009.<ref>{{cite news|title=Holy Sepulchre! 60 Million Buy 'The Da Vinci Code'|author=Daniel Henninger|url=https://www.wsj.com/google_login.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB114799749952457278.html%3Fmod%3Dgooglenews_wsj|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=May 18, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/entertainment/books/brown-is-back-with-the-code-for-a-runaway-bestseller/2009/09/12/1252519678923.html|work=Sydney Morning Herald|title=Brown is back with the code for a runaway bestseller|date=September 13, 2009|accessdate=September 13, 2009|author=Marcus, Caroline}}</ref> Its success has helped push sales of Brown's earlier books.

''The Times'' estimated his income from ''Da Vinci Code'' sales as $250 million.

Brown's third novel featuring Robert Langdon, ''[[The Lost Symbol]]'', was released on September 15, 2009.<ref name="bostonheraldannounce">{{cite web|url=http://bostonherald.com/entertainment/books/view/2009_04_20_Dan_Brown_announces_new_book___The_Lost_Symbol_/srvc=home&position=recent|title=Dan Brown announces newbook, 'The Lost Symbol'|accessdate=April 20, 2009|date=April 20, 2009|first=Gina|last=Carbone|publisher=[[Boston Herald]]}}</ref> According to the publisher, on its first day the book sold over one million in hardcover and e-book versions in the US, the UK and Canada, prompting the printing of 600,000 hardcover copies in addition to the five million first printing.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/16/dan-browns-lost-symbol-sells-1-million-copies-in-the-first-day/?scp=3&sq=Dan%20Brown&st=cse|title=Dan Brown's 'Lost Symbol' Sells 1 Million Copies in the First Day|date=September 16, 2009|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=September 16, 2009|first=Motoko|last=Rich}}</ref> The story takes place in Washington D.C. over a period of 12 hours, and features the [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]].

This repeats a theme from some of Brown's earlier work. {{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Brown's fourth novel featuring Robert Langdon, ''[[Inferno (Dan Brown novel)|Inferno]]'' is a mystery thriller novel released on May 14, 2013, by Doubleday.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/entertainment/2013/01/new-dan-brown-novel-inferno-set-for-may-release|title=New Dan Brown Novel, 'Inferno,' Set for May Release|last=McLaughlin|first=Erin|date=January 15, 2013|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=April 19, 2013}}</ref> It immediately became a bestseller.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books|newspaper=The New York Times|title=Bestsellers|date=June 23, 2013|accessdate=June 17, 2013}}</ref>

In a 2006 interview, Brown stated that he had ideas for about 12 future books featuring Robert Langdon.<ref>{{cite news|title='Da' Last Big Interview|date=March 26, 2006|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1176351_1,00.html|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=May 18, 2009|first=Gregory|last=Kirschling}}</ref>

Characters in Brown's books are often named after real people in his life. Robert Langdon is named after [[John Langdon (typographer)|John Langdon]], the artist who created the [[ambigrams]] used for the ''Angels & Demons'' CD and novel. [[Camerlengo]] Carlo Ventresca is named after ''[[On a Claire Day]]'' cartoonist friend [[Carla Ventresca]]. In the Vatican archives,  Langdon recalls a wedding of two people named Dick and Connie, which are the names of his parents. Robert Langdon's editor Jonas Faukman is named after Brown's real life editor Jason Kaufman. Brown also said that characters were based on a New Hampshire librarian, and a French teacher at Exeter, André Vernet. Cardinal Aldo Baggia, in ''Angels & Demons'', is named after Aldo Baggia, instructor of modern languages at Phillips Exeter Academy.<ref>Rogak, p. 22</ref>

In interviews, Brown has said his wife, Blythe, is an art historian and painter. When they met, she was the Director of Artistic Development at the National Academy for Songwriters in Los Angeles. During the 2006 lawsuit over alleged copyright infringement in ''The Da Vinci Code'', information was introduced at trial that showed that Blythe did research for the book.<ref>{{cite news|title=Librarian comments on 'Da Vinci' lawsuit|date=March 1, 2006|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2006-03-01-da-vinci-lawsuit_x.htm|work=USA Today|accessdate=May 18, 2009}}</ref> In one article, she was described as "chief researcher".<ref>{{cite news |title=Brown duels in court |date=March 16, 2006 |url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=18&art_id=14142&sid=7052348&con_type=1 |work=The Standard |accessdate=May 18, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524011135/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=18&art_id=14142&sid=7052348&con_type=1 |archivedate=May 24, 2009 |df=mdy }}</ref>

In late 2016, Brown has revealed that Doubleday will publish his next book, ''[[Origin (Dan Brown novel)|Origin]]'' on September 27, 2017. It is his seventh book published overall, and the fifth book in his [[Robert Langdon (book series)|''Robert Langdon'' series]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Raynor|first1=Madeline|title=Dan Brown's Origin gets fall 2017 release date|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/09/28/dan-brown-origin-fall-2017-release-date|website=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=October 19, 2016}}</ref>

====Influences and habits====
In addition to Sidney Sheldon, Brown has been quite vocal about a number of other literary influences who have inspired his writing. He has named his six favorite literary works as ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'' by [[Douglas Hofstadter]], ''Codes Ciphers & Other Cryptic & Clandestine Communication'' by Fred Wrixon, ''[[Of Mice and Men]]'' by [[John Steinbeck]], ''[[Wordplay: Ambigrams and Reflections on the Art of Ambigrams]]'' by John Langdon, [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' and ''[[The Puzzle Palace]]'' by [[James Bamford]]. Commenting on ''Much Ado About Nothing'', Brown says, "I didn't understand how funny this play ''Much Ado About Nothing'' truly was until I became an English teacher and had to teach it. There is no wittier dialogue anywhere." Speaking of [[Robert Ludlum]]'s ''[[Bourne (novel series)|The Bourne Trilogy]]'', he states, "Ludlum's early books are complex, smart, and yet still move at a lightning pace. This series got me interested in the genre of big-concept, international thrillers."<ref>[http://theweek.com/article/index/104613/dan-browns-6-favorite-books "Dan Brown's 6 favorite books"], theweek.com, September 18, 2009.</ref><ref name="Barnes&Noble">[http://www.barnesandnoble.com/writers/writerdetails.asp?cid=1040938 "Meet the Writers: Dan Brown"], barnesandnoble.com; retrieved September 8, 2013.</ref> His other favorite books include ''[[Kane and Abel (novel)|Kane and Abel]]'' by [[Jeffrey Archer]], ''[[Plum Island (novel)|Plum Island]]'' by [[Nelson DeMille]] and ''[[The Elements of Style]]'' by [[Strunk and White]].<ref name="Barnes&Noble"/> Recurring elements that Brown prefers to incorporate into his novels include a simple hero pulled out of their familiar setting and thrust into a new one with which they are unfamiliar, strong female characters, travel to interesting locations, and a 24-hour time frame in which the story takes place.<ref name=Themes/>

Because of the research-intensive nature of his novels, Brown can spend up to two years writing them. To remain focused on such projects, Brown ensures that when he chooses a theme for the novel (what he refers to as the "big idea"), and its subject, that they be those that can hold his interest. In Brown's view, the ideal topic does not have an easily defined right or wrong view, but presents a moral grey area that can lend itself to debate. Because his favorite subjects include codes, puzzles, treasure hunts, secretive organizations and academic lectures on obscure topics, he tends to incorporate those into his novels. Because Brown considers writing to be a discipline that requires constant practice, he has developed a routine to maintain his abilities. He wakes up at 4:00&nbsp;am when there are no distractions (a practice he began with ''[[Digital Fortress]]'' when he had two daytime teaching jobs) and when he feels most productive, in order to give symbolic importance to the first order of business each day. He keeps an antique [[hourglass]] on his desk, so that he can stop briefly every hour to do push-ups, sit-ups and stretching exercises to keep his blood flowing.<ref>Brown. Witness statement; Pages 6 & 7.</ref> Brown does his writing in his loft. He has also told fans that he uses [[inversion therapy]] to help with [[writer's block]]. He uses [[gravity boots]] and says, "hanging upside down seems to help me solve plot challenges by shifting my entire perspective".<ref>{{cite news|title=Brown plays down Code controversy|date=April 24, 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4937754.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=May 18, 2009}}</ref>

====Copyright infringement cases====
In August 2005 author [[Lewis Perdue]] unsuccessfully sued Brown for [[plagiarism]], on the basis of claimed similarity between ''The Da Vinci Code'' and his novels, ''The Da Vinci Legacy'' (1983) and ''Daughter of God'' (2000). Judge George Daniels said, in part: "A reasonable average lay observer would not conclude that ''The Da Vinci Code'' is substantially similar to ''Daughter of God''."<ref>{{cite news|title=Author Brown 'did not plagiarise'|date=August 6, 2005|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4126710.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=May 18, 2009}}</ref>

In April 2006 Brown's publisher, [[Random House]], won a [[copyright infringement]] case brought by authors [[Michael Baigent]] and [[Richard Leigh (author)|Richard Leigh]], who claimed that Brown stole ideas from their 1982 book ''[[Holy Blood Holy Grail]]'' for his 2003 novel ''The Da Vinci Code''. It was in the book ''Holy Blood Holy Grail'' that Baigent, Leigh, and co-author [[Henry Lincoln]] had advanced the theory that Jesus and [[Mary Magdalene]] married and had a child and that the bloodline continues to this day. Brown apparently alluded to the two authors' names in his book. [[List of The Da Vinci Code characters#Sir Leigh Teabing/The Teacher|Leigh Teabing]], a lead character in both the novel and the film, uses Leigh's name as the first name, and anagrammatically derives his last name from Baigent's. [[Peter Smith (judge)|Mr Justice Peter Smith]] found in Brown's favor in the case, and as a private amusement, embedded his own [[Smithy code]] in the written judgment.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4949488.stm|title=Judge creates own Da Vinci code|work=BBC News|date=April 27, 2006|accessdate=September 13, 2009}}</ref>

On March 28, 2007, Brown's publisher, [[Random House]], won an appeal [[copyright infringement]] case. The [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales]] rejected the efforts from Baigent and Leigh, who became liable for paying legal expenses of nearly US$6 million.<ref>{{cite news|title=Historians lose Da Vinci Code plagiarism appeal|date=March 28, 2007|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article1579277.ece|work=The Times|accessdate=May 18, 2009|location=London, UK|first=Michael|last=Herman}}</ref>

==Charity work==
In October 2004, Brown and his siblings donated US$2.2 million to [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] in honor of their father, to set up the Richard G.
