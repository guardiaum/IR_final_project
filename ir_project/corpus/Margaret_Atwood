== Early life and education ==
Atwood was born in [[Ottawa]], Ontario, Canada, as the second of three children<ref>[http://archives.cbc.ca/arts_entertainment/literature/topics/1494/ Margaret Atwood: Queen of CanLit]. CBC Archives.

Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]], and [[Toronto]]. She did not attend school full-time until she was eight years old. She became a voracious reader of literature, [[Dell Publishing|Dell]] pocketbook mysteries, ''[[Grimm's Fairy Tales]]'', Canadian animal stories and [[comic book]]s. She attended Leaside High School in [[Leaside]], Toronto, and graduated in 1957.<ref name="lumin" /> Atwood began writing plays and poems at the age of six.<ref name="Daley2007">{{cite book|last=Daley|first=James|title=Great Writers on the Art of Fiction: From Mark Twain to Joyce Carol Oates|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bzw1AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA159|year=2007|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=978-0-486-45128-2|page=159}}</ref>

Atwood realized she wanted to write professionally when she was 16.<ref>[http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/2262/margaret-atwood-the-art-of-fiction-no-121-margaret-atwood Margaret Atwood: The Art of Fiction No.121].The Paris Review.

In late 1961, after winning the [[E. J. Pratt]] Medal for her privately printed book of poems, ''[[Double Persephone]]'', she began graduate studies at Harvard's [[Radcliffe College]] with a [[Woodrow Wilson]] fellowship.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://alumni.utoronto.ca/portrait/margaret-atwood/|title=University of Toronto Alumni Website  » Margaret Atwood|website=alumni.utoronto.ca|access-date=2017-01-24}}</ref> She obtained a master's degree (MA) from Radcliffe in 1962 and pursued doctoral studies at [[Harvard University]] for two years, but did not finish her dissertation, "The English Metaphysical Romance".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/09/21/reviews/oates-poet.html|title=On Being a Poet: A Conversation With Margaret Atwood|website=www.nytimes.com|access-date=2017-01-24}}</ref>

==Career==

=== Teaching ===
She taught at the [[University of British Columbia]] in 1965, the [[Sir George Williams University]] in [[Montreal]] from 1967 to 1968, the [[University of Alberta]] from 1969 to 1970, [[York University]] in Toronto from 1971 to 1972, the [[University of Alabama]] in [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]] in 1985, where she was visiting M.F.A.

=== Writing ===
==== Feminism ====
Atwood, who was surrounded by the intellectual dialogue of the female faculty members at Victoria College, often portrays female characters dominated by [[patriarchy]] in her novels. She also sheds light on women's social oppression as a result from patriarchal ideology.<ref>Cooke, Nathalie. ''Margaret Atwood: A Critical Companion''. Connecticut: Greenwood Press, 2005. Print.</ref> Still, Atwood denies that ''[[The Edible Woman]]'', published in 1969 and coinciding with the early [[second-wave feminism|second wave of the feminist movement]], for example, is [[feminism|feminist]], and claims that she wrote it four years before the movement. Atwood believes that the feminist label can only be applied to writers who consciously work within the framework of the [[feminist movement]].<ref>Tolan, Fiona. Margaret Atwood: Feminism and Fiction. Netherlands: Rodopi B.V., 2007. Print.</ref>

==== Speculative fiction and social science fiction ====
Atwood has resisted the suggestion that ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]'' and ''[[Oryx and Crake]]'' are science fiction, suggesting to ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2003 that they are [[speculative fiction]] instead: "Science fiction has monsters and spaceships; speculative fiction could really happen."<ref name=guardian>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/apr/26/fiction.margaretatwood |title=Light in the wilderness |work=The Guardian |last=Potts |first=Robert |date=April 26, 2003 |accessdate=May 30, 2013}}</ref> She told the [[Book of the Month Club]]: "''Oryx and Crake'' is a speculative fiction, not a science fiction proper. It contains no intergalactic space travel, no teleportation, no Martians."<ref name=langford /> On ''[[BBC Breakfast]]'', she explained that science fiction, as opposed to what she herself wrote, was "talking squids in outer space." The latter phrase particularly rankled [[science fiction fandom|advocates of science fiction]] and frequently recurs when her writing is discussed.<ref name=langford>[[David Langford|Langford, David]], "Bits and Pieces" [[SFX (magazine)|''SFX'' magazine]] No.&nbsp;107, August 2003 [http://www.ansible.co.uk/sfx/sfx107.html ]</ref>

In 2005, Atwood said that she does at times write [[social science fiction]] and that ''The Handmaid's Tale'' and ''Oryx and Crake'' can be designated as such. She clarified her meaning on the difference between speculative and science fiction, admitting that others use the terms interchangeably: "For me, the science fiction label belongs on books with things in them that we can't yet do... speculative fiction means a work that employs the means already to hand and that takes place on Planet Earth." She said that science fiction narratives give a writer the ability to explore themes in ways that realistic fiction cannot.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/jun/17/sciencefictionfantasyandhorror.margaretatwood Atwood, Margaret. "Aliens have taken the place of angels: Margaret Atwood on why we need science fiction," ''[[The Guardian]]'', June 17, 2005.]</ref>

=== Invention of the LongPen ===
In early 2004, while on the paperback tour in Denver for her novel ''[[Oryx and Crake]]'', Atwood conceived the concept of a remote robotic writing technology, what would later be known as the [[LongPen]], that would enable a person to remotely write in ink anywhere in the world via tablet PC and the Internet, thus allowing her to conduct her book tours without being physically present. She quickly founded a company, Unotchit Inc., to develop, produce and distribute this technology. By 2011, Unotchit Inc. shifted its market focus into business and legal transactions and was producing a range of products, for a variety of remote writing applications, based on the LongPen technologies and renamed itself to Syngrafii Inc. As of September 2014, Atwood is still Co-founder and a Director of Syngrafii Inc. and holder of various patents related to the LongPen technology.<ref name="theguardian.com"/><ref name="investing.businessweek.com"/><ref name="ABSTRACT & PATENT DETAILS"/><ref>{{cite web|title=LongPen Finds Short Path to Success|url=http://www.quanser.com/unotchit_case_study}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Robotic arm extend authors’ signatures over cyberspace |url=http://www.design-engineering.com/motion-control/robotic-arm-extend-authors-signatures-over-cyberspace-10411 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140902020835/http://www.design-engineering.com/motion-control/robotic-arm-extend-authors-signatures-over-cyberspace-10411 |archivedate=September 2, 2014 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Syngrafii Corp. |url=http://www.syngrafii.com/about-us/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018225244/http://www.syngrafii.com/about-us/ |archivedate=October 18, 2014 |df= }}</ref>

=== Chamber opera ===
In March 2008, Atwood accepted her first chamber opera commission. ''[[Pauline (chamber opera)|Pauline]]'', a [[chamber opera]] in two acts composed by [[Tobin Stokes]] to a libretto by Atwood premiered on May 23, 2014 at Vancouver's York Theatre. Commissioned by [[City Opera of Vancouver]], the opera is set in [[Vancouver]] in March 1913 during the final days of the life of Canadian writer and performer [[Pauline Johnson]].<ref>''[[Vancouver Sun]]'' (March 11, 2008). [http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=45d3df1d-8744-4b72-bd52-4ef6ca1d8ab3&k=19276 "Atwood pens opera piece about Vancouver first nations writer-performer"].

== Critical reception ==
In 2008, ''[[The Economist]]'' called her a "scintillating wordsmith" and an "expert literary critic", but commented that her logic does not match her prose in ''[[Payback: Debt and the Shadow Side of Wealth]]'',<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.economist.com/books/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12414948 | title = Premium content |work=The Economist  |date=October 16, 2008 |accessdate=October 26, 2009}}</ref> a book which commences with the conception of debt and its kinship with justice.

In 1984, she was the subject of a documentary film by [[Michael Rubbo]], ''[[Margaret Atwood: Once in August]]''.<ref>{{cite video | url=http://www.nfb.ca/film/margaret_atwood_once_in_august/ | title=Margaret Atwood: Once in August | publisher=[[National Film Board of Canada]] | date=1984 | people=[[Michael Rubbo]] | medium=Documentary film}}</ref><ref name="Yorke">{{cite book | title=The Cambridge Companion to Margaret Atwood | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Yorke, Lorraine | year=2006 | isbn=978-0521839662 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NaRuLnhbl2QC&pg=PA40&dq=Margaret+Atwood:+Once+in+August&hl=en&sa=X&ei=T9vYT6WnD-rk6QHu-8CtAw&ved=0CE0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=Margaret%20Atwood%3A%20Once%20in%20August&f=false| page=40 | editor=Coral Ann Howells | chapter=Biography/autobiography}}</ref> In 2003, [[Shaftesbury Films]] produced an anthology series, ''[[The Atwood Stories]]'', which dramatized six of Atwood's short stories.

==Recurring themes==

===Contribution to the theorizing of Canadian identity===
Atwood’s contributions to the theorizing of Canadian identity have garnered attention both in Canada and internationally. Her principal work of literary criticism, ''[[Survival: A Thematic Guide to Canadian Literature]]'', is considered outdated in Canada but unfortunately remains the standard introduction to Canadian literature in [[Canadian Studies]] programs internationally.<ref name="Moss2006">{{cite book| last = Moss
| first = Laura| authorlink = Laura Moss| editor = John Moss| editor2 = Tobi Kozakewich| title = "Margaret Atwood: Branding an Icon Abroad" in Margaret Atwood: The Open Eye| publisher=University of Ottawa Press| year = 2006| location = Ottawa| page = 28}}</ref>

In ''Survival'', Atwood postulates that Canadian literature, and by extension Canadian identity, is characterized by the symbol of survival.<ref>{{cite book| last = Atwood| first = Margaret| title = Survival: A Thematic Guide to Canadian Literature| publisher=Anansi
| year = 1972| location = Toronto| page = 32}}</ref> This symbol is expressed in the omnipresent use of “victim positions” in Canadian literature. These positions represent a scale of self-consciousness and self-actualization for the victim in the “victor/victim” relationship.<ref name="Atwood, M. 1972, 36-42">Atwood, M. (1972), 36–42.</ref> The "victor" in these scenarios may be other humans, nature, the wilderness or other external and internal factors which oppress the victim.<ref name="Atwood, M. 1972, 36-42"/> Atwood’s ''Survival'' bears the influence of [[Northrop Frye]]’s theory of [[garrison mentality]]; Atwood instrumentalizes Frye’s concept to a critical tool.<ref name="Pache2002">{{cite book| last = Pache| first = Walter| editor = Reingard M. Nischik, Ed.| title = "A Certain Frivolity: Margaret Atwood's Literary Criticism" in Margaret Atwood: Works and Impact| publisher=Anansi| year = 2002| location = Toronto| page = 122}}</ref> Atwood continued her exploration of the implications of Canadian literary themes for Canadian identity in lectures such as ''Strange Things: The Malevolent North in Canadian Literature'' (1995). The continued reprinting of ''Survival'' by Anansi Press and Atwood has been criticized as a disservice to students of Canadian Literature. (Pivato 2015)

Atwood's contribution to the theorizing of Canada is not limited to her non-fiction works. Several of her works, including ''[[The Journals of Susanna Moodie]]'', ''[[Alias Grace]]'', ''[[The Blind Assassin]]'' and ''[[Surfacing (novel)|Surfacing]]'', are examples of what postmodern literary theorist [[Linda Hutcheon]] calls “[[Historiographic metafiction]]”.<ref name="Howells2006">{{cite book| last = Howells| first = Coral Ann| editor = John Moss| editor2= Tobi Kozakewich| title = "Writing History from The Journals of Susanna Moodie to The Blind Assassin" in Margaret Atwood: The Open Eye| publisher=University of Ottawa Press| year = 2006| location = Ottawa| page = 111
}}</ref> In such works, Atwood explicitly explores the relation of history and narrative and the processes of creating history.

Ultimately, according to her theories in works such as ''Survival'' and her exploration of similar themes in her fiction, Atwood considers Canadian literature as the expression of Canadian identity. According to this literature, Canadian identity has been defined by a fear of nature, by settler history, and by unquestioned adherence to the community.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===Animals===
Margaret Atwood has repeatedly made observations about our relationships to animals in her works. In ''Surfacing'', one character remarks about eating animals: "The animals die that we may live, they are substitute people...And we eat them, out of cans or otherwise; we are eaters of death, dead Christ-flesh resurrecting inside us, granting us life." Some characters in her books link sexual oppression to meat-eating and consequently give up meat-eating. In ''[[The Edible Woman]]'', Atwood's character Marian identifies with hunted animals and cries after hearing her fiancé's experience of hunting and eviscerating a rabbit. Marian stops eating meat but then later returns to it.<ref name="Carol J. Adams 2006. p141-142">Carol J. Adams. 2006. The Sexual Politics of Meat: A Feminist-Vegetarian Critical Theory. The Continuum International Publishing Group. p141-142, 152, 195, 197.</ref>

In ''[[Cat's Eye (novel)|Cat's Eye]]'', the narrator recognizes the similarity between a turkey and a baby. She looks at "the turkey, which resembles a trussed, headless baby. It has thrown off its disguise as a meal and has revealed itself to me for what it is, a large dead bird." In Atwood's ''[[Surfacing (novel)|Surfacing]]'', a dead heron represents purposeless killing and prompts thoughts about other senseless deaths.<ref name="Carol J. Adams 2006. p141-142"/>

=== Political involvement ===
In her [[dystopia]]n novel, ''The Handmaid's Tale'', all the horrible developments take place in the United States near Boston, while Canada is portrayed as the only hope for an escape.  This reflects her status of being "in the vanguard of Canadian anti-Americanism of the 1960s and 1970s."<ref>{{cite book|author=Reingard M.

Atwood has indicated in interviews that she considers herself a [[Red Tory]] in the historical sense of the term.<ref>[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]:''[http://www.motherjones.com/arts/qa/1997/07/visions.html Margaret Atwood: The activist author of Alias Grace and The Handmaid's Tale discusses the politics of art and the art of the con].'' July/August 1997</ref> Atwood and her partner [[Graeme Gibson]] are strong supporters of [[Green Party of Canada]] leader, [[Elizabeth May]]. Atwood has strong views on environmental issues, and she and Gibson are the joint honorary presidents of the Rare Bird Club within [[BirdLife International]]. She has been chair of the [[Writers' Union of Canada]] and president of [[PEN Canada]], and is currently a vice-president of PEN International. In the [[Canadian federal election, 2008|2008 federal election]], she attended a rally for the [[Bloc Québécois]], a [[Quebec]] separatist party, because of her support for their position on the arts, and stated that she would vote for the party if she lived in a riding in Quebec in which the choice was between the Bloc and the Conservatives.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/canadavotes/story/2008/10/03/duceppe-to.html | title = Canada Votes&nbsp;— Atwood backs Bloc on arts defence |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=October 4, 2008 |accessdate=21 February 2015}}</ref> In a ''Globe and Mail'' editorial, she urged Canadians to vote for any other party to stop a Conservative majority.<ref>Margaret, Atwood.

Atwood celebrated her 70th birthday at a gala dinner at [[Laurentian University]] in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], Ontario, marking the final stop of her international tour to promote ''The Year of the Flood''. She stated that she had chosen to attend the event because the city has been home to one of Canada's most ambitious environmental reclamation programs: "When people ask if there's hope (for the environment), I say, if Sudbury can do it, so can you. Having been a symbol of desolation, it's become a symbol of hope."<ref>[http://www.northernlife.ca/news/lifestyle/2009/nov/atwood-231109.aspx "Sudbury a symbol of hope: Margaret Atwood"].

Despite calls for a boycott by [[Gaza Strip|Gazan]] students, Atwood visited [[Israel]] and accepted the $1,000,000 [[Dan David Prize]] along with Indian author [[Amitav Ghosh]] at [[Tel Aviv University]] in May 2010.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://electronicintifada.net/v2/article11186.shtml | title = Gaza students to Margaret Atwood: reject Tel Aviv U. prize | publisher=ei}}</ref> Atwood commented that "we don't do cultural boycotts."<ref>{{cite news|last=Ackerman |first=Gwen | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601088&sid=a3UDSV5teRIA | title = Atwood Accepts Israeli Prize, Defends 'Artists Without Armies': Interview | publisher=Bloomberg |accessdate=September 19, 2010 | date=May 9, 2010}}</ref>

''[[In the Wake of the Flood]]'', a documentary film by Canadian director [[Ron Mann]] released in October 2010, followed Atwood on the unusual book tour for her novel ''The Year of the Flood''. During this innovative book tour, Atwood created a theatrical version of her novel, with performers borrowed from the local areas she was visiting. The documentary is described as "a fly-on-the-wall [[Cinéma vérité|film vérité]]."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://yearoftheflood.com/ca/tour/wake-of-the-flood |title=In the Wake of the Flood |website=The Year of the Flood |accessdate=March 30, 2011}}</ref>

Since February 2013, Atwood made it clear via [[Twitter]] that she strongly opposed the [[University of Toronto]] putting in an [[artificial turf]] field and hinted that she might write the university out of her will if it proceeded with the plan. This was not the first time she had openly challenged the university.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2013/03/12/margaret_atwood_tweets_opposition_to_u_of_ts_plan_for_artificial_turf.html |title=Margaret Atwood tweets opposition to U of T’s plan for artificial turf |last=Kalinowski |first=Tess |work=The Toronto Star |date=March 24, 2013 |accessdate=August 8, 2013}}</ref>

== Future Library project ==
With her novel ''Scribbler Moon'', Atwood is the first contributor to the [[Future Library project]]. The work, completed in 2015, was ceremoniously handed over to the project on 27 May of the same year. The book will be held by the project until its eventual publishing in 2114.
