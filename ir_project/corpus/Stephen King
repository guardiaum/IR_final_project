King's mother was Nellie Ruth (née Pillsbury)
When Stephen King was two years old, his father left the family under the pretense of "going to buy a pack of cigarettes", leaving his mother to raise Stephen and his older brother, David, by herself, sometimes under great financial strain
The family moved to De Pere, Wisconsin, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and Stratford, Connecticut
When King was 11, the family returned to Durham, Maine, where his mother cared for her parents until their deaths
She then became a caregiver in a local residential facility for the mentally challenged
King was raised Methodist and remains religious as an adult
As a child, King apparently witnessed one of his friends being struck and killed by a train, though he has no memory of the event
His family told him that after leaving home to play with the boy, King returned, speechless and seemingly in shock
Only later did the family learn of the friend's death
Some commentators have suggested that this event may have psychologically inspired some of King's darker works, but King makes no mention of it in his memoir On Writing (2000)
King related in detail his primary inspiration for writing horror fiction in his non-fiction Danse Macabre (1981), in a chapter titled "An Annoying Autobiographical Pause"
King compares his uncle's successfully dowsing for water using the bough of an apple branch with the sudden realization of what he wanted to do for a living
That inspiration occurred while browsing through an attic with his elder brother, when King uncovered a paperback version of an H. P. Lovecraft collection of short stories he remembers as The Lurker in the Shadows, that had belonged to his father
King told Barnes & Noble Studios during a 2009 interview, "I knew that I'd found home when I read that book
"

King attended Durham Elementary School and graduated from Lisbon Falls High School, in Lisbon Falls, Maine
He displayed an early interest in horror as an avid reader of EC's horror comics, including Tales from the Crypt (he later paid tribute to the comics in his screenplay for Creepshow)
He began writing for fun while still in school, contributing articles to Dave's Rag, the newspaper his brother published with a mimeograph machine, and later began selling to his friends stories based on movies he had seen (though when discovered by his teachers, he was forced to return the profits)
The first of his stories to be independently published was "I Was a Teenage Grave Robber" it was serialized over four issues (three published and one unpublished) of a fanzine, Comics Review, in 1965
That story was published the following year in a revised form as "In a Half-World of Terror" in another fanzine, Stories of Suspense, edited by Marv Wolfman
King has also stated that he likes heavy metal and has named bands like Anthrax, Judas Priest and Metallica as amongst his favourites to write to
In 1988, the band Blue Öyster Cult recorded an updated version of its 1974 song "Astronomy"
The single released for radio play featured a narrative intro spoken by King
The Blue Öyster Cult song "(Don't Fear) The Reaper" was also used in the King TV series The Stand
King collaborated with Michael Jackson to create Ghosts (1996), a 40-minute musical video
King states he was motivated to collaborate as he is "always interested in trying something new, and for (him), writing a minimusical would be new"
In 2012 King collaborated with musician Shooter Jennings and his band Hierophant, providing the narration for their album, Black Ribbons
King played guitar for the rock band Rock Bottom Remainders, several of whose members are authors
Other members include Dave Barry, Ridley Pearson, Scott Turow, Amy Tan, James McBride, Mitch Albom, Roy Blount, Jr
, Matt Groening, Kathi Kamen Goldmark, Sam Barry, and Greg Iles
King and the other band members collaborated to release an e-book called Hard Listening: The Greatest Rock Band Ever (of Authors) Tells All (June 2013)
King wrote a musical play Ghost Brothers of Darkland County (2012) with musician John Mellencamp
Analysis

Writing style

King's formula for learning to write well is: "Read and write four to six hours a day
If you cannot find the time for that, you can't expect to become a good writer
" He sets out each day with a quota of 2000 words and will not stop writing until it is met
He also has a simple definition for talent in writing: "If you wrote something for which someone sent you a check, if you cashed the check and it didn't bounce, and if you then paid the light bill with the money, I consider you talented
"Everything You Need to Know About Writing Successfully—in Ten Minutes

Shortly after his accident, King wrote the first draft of the book Dreamcatcher with a notebook and a Waterman fountain pen, which he called "the world's finest word processor"
When asked why he writes, King responds: "The answer to that is fairly simple—there was nothing else I was made to do
I was made to write stories and I love to write stories
That's why I do it
I really can't imagine doing anything else and I can't imagine not doing what I do
" He is also often asked why he writes such terrifying stories and he answers with another question: "Why do you assume I have a choice?" King usually begins the story creation process by imagining a "what if" scenario, such as what would happen if a writer is kidnapped by a sadistic nurse in Colorado
Jenna Blum, 2013, The Modern Scholar published by Recorded Books, The Author at Work: The Art of Writing Fiction, Disk 1, Track 11, 

King often uses authors as characters, or includes mention of fictional books in his stories, novellas and novels, such as Paul Sheldon who is the main character in Misery, adult Bill Denbrough in It, Ben Mears in Salem's Lot, and Jack Torrance in The Shining
He has extended this to breaking the fourth wall by including himself as a character in the Dark Tower series from Wolves of the Calla onwards

Influences

King has called Richard Matheson "the author who influenced me most as a writer"
In a current edition of Matheson's The Shrinking Man, King is quoted: "A horror story if there ever was one
a great adventure story—it is certainly one of that select handful that I have given to people, envying them the experience of the first reading
" Ray Bradbury is another influence, with King himself stating "without Ray Bradbury, there is no Stephen King"
King refers to H. P. Lovecraft several times in Danse Macabre
"Gramma", a short story made into a film in the 1980s anthology horror show The New Twilight Zone, mentions Lovecraft's notorious fictional creation Necronomicon, also borrowing the names of a number of the fictional monsters mentioned therein
"I Know What You Need" from the 1976 collection Night Shift, and 'Salem's Lot also mention the tome
Despite this, in On Writing, King is critical of Lovecraft's dialogue-writing skills, using passages from "The Colour Out of Space" as particularly poor examples
There are also several examples of King's referring to Lovecraftian characters and settings in his work, such as Nyarlathotep and Yog-Sothoth
King acknowledges the influence of Bram Stoker, particularly on his novel Salem's Lot, which he envisioned as a retelling of Dracula

King has also referred to author Shirley Jackson
Salem's Lot opens with a quotation from Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House, and a character in Wolves of the Calla references the Jackson book We Have Always Lived in the Castle
King's book 11/22/63 mentions the Jackson story "The Summer People"
King is a fan of John D. MacDonald, and dedicated the novella "Sun Dog" to MacDonald, saying "I miss you, old friend
" For his part, MacDonald wrote an admiring preface to Night Shift, and even had his famous character, Travis McGee, reading Cujo in one of the last McGee novels and Pet Sematary in the last McGee novel, The Lonely Silver Rain
In 1987, King's Philtrum Press published Don Robertson's novel, The Ideal, Genuine Man
In his forenote to the novel, King wrote, "Don Robertson was and is one of the three writers who influenced me as a young man who was trying to 'become' a novelist (the other two being Richard Matheson and John D. MacDonald)
" Robert A. Heinlein's book The Door into Summer is repeatedly mentioned in King's Wolves of the Calla (2003), as are several other works
Wolves of the Calla is the King work in which The Dark Tower begins to follow a meta-fictional path
In an interview with King, published in the USA Weekend in March 2009, the author stated, "People look on writers that they like as an irreplaceable resource

Critical response

Although critical reaction to King's work has been mostly positive, he has occasionally come under fire from academic writers
Science fiction editors John Clute and Peter NicholsClute, John and Peter Nichols
The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction
New York: St
Martin's Griffin, 1993
offer a largely favorable appraisal of King, noting his "pungent prose, sharp ear for dialogue, disarmingly laid-back, frank style, along with his passionately fierce denunciation of human stupidity and cruelty (especially to children) [all of which rank] him among the more distinguished 'popular' writers
"

In his book The Philosophy of Horror (1990), Noël Carroll discusses King's work as an exemplar of modern horror fiction
Analyzing both the narrative structure of King's fiction and King's non-fiction ruminations on the art and craft of writing, Carroll writes that for King, "the horror story is always a contest between the normal and the abnormal such that the normal is reinstated and, therefore, affirmed

In his analysis of post–World War II horror fiction, The Modern Weird Tale (2001), critic S. T. JoshiJoshi, S.T, The Modern Weird Tale: A Critique of Horror Fiction, McFarland & Company, 2001,  devotes a chapter to King's work
Joshi argues that King's best-known works (his supernatural novels), are his worst, describing them as mostly bloated, illogical, maudlin and prone to deus ex machina endings
Despite these criticisms, Joshi argues that since Gerald's Game (1993), King has been tempering the worst of his writing faults, producing books that are leaner, more believable and generally better written
Joshi suggests that King's strengths as a writer include the accessible "everyman" quality of his prose, and his unfailingly insightful observations about the pains and joys of adolescence
Joshi cites two early non-supernatural novels—Rage (1977) and The Running Man (1982)—as King's best, suggesting both are riveting and well-constructed suspense thrillers, with believable characters

In his short story collection A Century of Great Suspense Stories, editor Jeffery Deaver noted that King "singlehandedly made popular fiction grow up
While there were many good best-selling writers before him, King, more than anybody since John D. MacDonald, brought reality to genre novels
He has often remarked that 'Salem's Lot was "Peyton Place meets Dracula
And so it was
The rich characterization, the careful and caring social eye, the interplay of story line and character development announced that writers could take worn themes such as vampirism and make them fresh again
Before King, many popular writers found their efforts to make their books serious blue-penciled by their editors
‘Stuff like that gets in the way of the story,' they were told
Well, it's stuff like that that has made King so popular, and helped free the popular name from the shackles of simple genre writing
He is a master of masters

In 2003, King was honored by the National Book Awards with a lifetime achievement award, the Medal of Distinguished Contribution to American Letters
Some in the literary community expressed disapproval of the award: Richard E. Snyder, the former CEO of Simon & Schuster, described King's work as "non-literature", and critic Harold Bloom denounced the choice:

The decision to give the National Book Foundation's annual award for "distinguished contribution" to Stephen King is extraordinary, another low in the shocking process of dumbing down our cultural life
I've described King in the past as a writer of penny dreadfuls, but perhaps even that is too kind
He shares nothing with Edgar Allan Poe
What he is is an immensely inadequate writer on a sentence-by-sentence, paragraph-by-paragraph, book-by-book basis
However, others came to King's defense, such as writer Orson Scott Card, who responded:

Let me assure you that King's work most definitely is literature, because it was written to be published and is read with admiration
What Snyder really means is that it is not the literature preferred by the academic-literary elite
King himself later stated:

[Harold] Bloom never pissed me off because there are critics out there, and he's one of them, who take their ignorance about popular culture as a badge of intellectual prowess
He might be able to say that Mark Twain is a great writer, but it's impossible for him to say that there's a direct line of descent from, say, Nathaniel Hawthorne to Jim Thompson because he doesn't read guys like Thompson
He just thinks, "I never read him, but I know he's terrible
"

In Roger Ebert's review of the 2004 movie Secret Window, he stated, "A lot of people were outraged that [King] was honored at the National Book Awards, as if a popular writer could not be taken seriously
But after finding that his book On Writing had more useful and observant things to say about the craft than any book since Strunk and White's The Elements of Style, I have gotten over my own snobbery
"

In 2008, King's book On Writing was ranked 21st on Entertainment Weekly list of "The New Classics: The 100 Best Reads from 1983 to 2008"

Driver Bryan Edwin Smith, distracted by an unrestrained dog moving in the back of his minivan, struck King, who landed in a depression in the ground about 14 feet (4 meters) from the pavement of Route 5. According to Oxford County Sheriff deputy Matt Baker, King was hit from behind and some witnesses said the driver was not speeding, reckless, or drinking
In his book On Writing King states he was heading north, walking against the traffic
Shortly before the accident took place, a woman in a car also heading north passed first King and then the light blue Dodge van
The van was looping from one side of the road to the other and the woman told her passenger she hoped "that guy in the van doesn't hit him"

King visited the space while his books and belongings were packed away
What he saw was an image of what his studio would look like if he died, providing a seed for his novel Lisey's Story (2006)

He has since resumed writing, but states on his website:

Political activism

In April 2008, King spoke out against HB 1423, a bill pending in the Massachusetts state legislature that would restrict or ban the sale of violent video games to anyone under the age of 18
Although King stated that he had no personal interest in video games as a hobby, he criticized the proposed law, which he sees as an attempt by politicians to scapegoat pop culture, and to act as surrogate parents to other peoples' children, which he asserted is usually "disastrous" and "undemocratic
"  He also saw the law as inconsistent, as it would forbid a 17-year-old, legally able to see Hostel: Part II, from buying or renting Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, which is violent but less graphic
While conceding that he saw no artistic merit in some violent video games, King also opined that such games reflect the violence that already exists in society, which would not be lessened by such a law, and would be redundant in light of the ratings system that already exists for video games
King argued that such laws allow legislators to ignore the economic divide between the rich and poor, and the easy availability of guns, which he felt were the more legitimate causes of violence

Regarding video games, he later stated that he enjoys playing light gun shooter arcade games such as Time Crisis
A controversy emerged on May 5, 2008, when Noel Sheppard posted a clip of King at a Library of Congress reading event on the website NewsBusters
King, talking to high-school students, had said: "If you can read, you can walk into a job later on
If you don't, then you've got the Army, Iraq, I don't know, something like that
"  The comment was described by the blog as "another in a long line of liberal media members bashing the military," and likened to John Kerry's similar remark from 2006
King responded later that day, saying, "That a right-wing-blog would impugn my patriotism because I said children should learn to read, and could get better jobs by doing so, is beneath contempt
I live in a national guard town, and I support our troops, but I don't support either the war or educational policies that limit the options of young men and women to any one career—military or otherwise
"  King again defended his comment in an interview with the Bangor Daily News on May 8, saying, "I'm not going to apologize for promoting that kids get better education in high school, so they have more options
Those that don't agree with what I'm saying, I'm not going to change their minds

Maine politics

King had endorsed Shenna Bellows in the 2014 U.S
Senate election for the seat held by Republican Susan Collins
King is a public critic of Paul LePage, the Republican Governor of Maine, and has referred to LePage as one of the Three Stooges, along with Florida Governor Rick Scott and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker
He was critical of LePage for incorrectly suggesting in a weekly radio address on March 18, 2015, that King avoided paying Maine income taxes by living out of state for part of the year
The statement was later corrected by the Governor's office but no apology was issued
King said LePage was "full of the stuff that makes the grass grow green" and demanded that LePage "man up and apologize"
LePage declined to apologize to King, stating "I never said Stephen King did not pay income taxes
What I said was, Stephen King's not in Maine right now
That's what I said
"  LePage further told King that he should "make me the villain of your next book and I won’t charge you royalties"
The attention garnered by the LePage criticism has led to efforts to encourage King to run for Governor of Maine in 2018
Bangor city councilor Joe Baldacci posted on his Facebook page that he was starting a Draft Stephen King effort, and Democratic State Rep
Diane Russell launched a petition drive to encourage King to run
His spokeswoman posted to Baldacci's Facebook comment that he would likely decline to run, and King himself stated he would not run or serve on March 23 while still criticizing what he said was the "laziness that made him mad" about not checking his tax payments and that LePage had "a problem finding a comfortable pair of big-boy pants"
King sent a tweet on June 30, 2015, stating that LePage is "a terrible embarrassment to the state I live in and love
