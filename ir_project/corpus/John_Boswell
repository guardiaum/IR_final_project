'''John Eastburn Boswell''' (March 20, 1947&nbsp;– December 24, 1994) was a historian and a full professor at [[Yale University]]. Many of Boswell's studies focused on the issue of [[religion and homosexuality]], specifically [[Christianity and homosexuality]]. All of his work focused on the history of those at the margins of society.

His first book, ''The Royal Treasure: Muslim Communities Under the Crown of Aragon in the Fourteenth Century'', appeared in 1977. In 1994, Boswell's fourth book, ''[[Same-Sex Unions in Pre-Modern Europe]]'', was published, but he died that same year from [[AIDS]]-related complications.

===Career===
A medieval [[philology|philologist]], Boswell read or spoke seventeen languages, including [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Old Church Slavonic]], [[Ancient Greek]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Akkadian]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Latin]].<ref>Jane Kamensky, 'Fighting (over) words', in Richard Wightman Fox, Robert B.

'''Books'''<br>
''The Royal Treasure'' (1977) is a detailed historical study of the [[Mudéjar]] [[Muslims]] in [[Aragon]] in the 14th century.

''Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality'' (1980) is a work which, according to [[George Chauncey|Chauncey]] et al. (1989), "offered a revolutionary interpretation of the Western tradition, arguing that the Roman Catholic Church had not condemned gay people throughout its history, but rather, at least until the twelfth century, had alternately evinced no special concern about homosexuality or actually celebrated love between men."  The book won a [[National Book Award]]<!-- National Book Awards were called "American" for several years from 1980, but must not be confused with [[American Book Awards]]
 --><ref name=nba1981/><ref group=lower-alpha name=paper/> and the [[Stonewall Book Award]] in 1981, but Boswell's thesis was criticized by Warren Johansson, Wayne R. Dynes and [[John Lauritsen]], who believed that he had attempted to whitewash the historic crimes of the Christian Church against gay men.<ref>[http://www.pinktriangle.org.uk/lib/hic/ Homosexuality, Intolerance, and Christianity: A Critical Examination of John Boswell's Work<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

''The Kindness of Strangers: Child Abandonment in Western Europe from Late Antiquity to the Renaissance'' (1988) is a scholarly study of the widespread practice of abandoning unwanted children and the means by which society tries to care for them. The title, as Boswell states in the Introduction, is inspired by a puzzling phrase Boswell had found in a number of documents: ''aliena misericordia'', which might at first seem to mean "a strange kindness", is better translated "the kindness of strangers."

''[[Same-Sex Unions in Pre-Modern Europe|The Marriage of Likeness: Same-Sex Unions in Pre-Modern Europe]]'' (New York: Villard, 1994) argues that the ''[[Adelphopoiesis|adelphopoiia]]'' liturgy was evidence that the attitude of the [[List of Christian denominational positions on homosexuality|Christian church towards homosexuality]] has changed over time, and that early [[Christianity|Christians]] did on occasion accept same-sex relationships.<ref>[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/index-bos.html "People with a History: An Online Guide to Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Trans* History"]. [[Fordham University]], 1997.</ref>

Rites of so-called "same-sex union" (Boswell's proposed translation) occur in ancient prayer-books of both the western and eastern churches. They are rites of ''[[adelphopoiesis]]'', literally [[Greek language|Greek]] for the making of brothers. Boswell, stated that these should be regarded as sexual unions similar to marriages. Boswell made many detailed translations of these rites in ''Same-Sex Unions'', and stated that one mass [[Same-sex marriage|gay wedding]] occurred only a couple of centuries ago in the [[Archbasilica of St. John Lateran]], the cathedral seat of the [[Pope]] as [[Bishop of Rome]]. This is a highly controversial point of Boswell's text, as other scholars have dissenting views of this interpretation, and believe that they were instead rites of becoming adopted brothers, or "blood brothers."<ref>[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/sykeon-adelpho.html "The Life of St. Theodore of Sykeon (7th Century)"].

===Faith and sexuality===
Boswell was a Roman Catholic, having converted from the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] of his upbringing at age 15. He remained a daily-mass Catholic up until his death, despite  differences with the church over sexual issues. Although he was orthodox in most of his beliefs, he strongly disagreed with his church's stated opposition to homosexual behavior and relationships. He was partnered with Jerone Hart for some twenty years until his death. Hart and Boswell are buried together at [[Grove Street Cemetery]], New Haven, Connecticut.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://yamp.org/Profiles/JohnBoswell|title=Known as Jeb}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/nhregister/obituary.aspx?pid=146866680|title=Jerone Hart obituary}}</ref>

In "Revolutions, Universals, and Sexual Categories", Boswell compares the [[Social constructionism|constructionist]]&ndash;[[essentialism|essentialist]] positions to the [[Philosophical realism|realist]]&ndash;[[nominalist]] dichotomy. He also lists three types of sexual [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]]:
* All or most humans are polymorphously sexual... external accidents, such as socio-cultural pressure, legal sanctions, religious beliefs, historical or personal circumstances determine the actual expression of each person's sexual feelings.
* Two or more sexual categories, usually, but not always based on sexual object choice.
* One type of sexual response [is] normal... all other variants abnormal.

===Death===
Boswell died of complications from AIDS in the Yale infirmary<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/25/obituaries/john-e-boswell-47-historian-of-medieval-gay-culture-dies.html?scp=2&sq=john%20boswell&st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=John E. Boswell, 47, Historian Of Medieval Gay Culture, Dies | first=David W. | last=Dunlap | date=December 25, 1994 | accessdate=May 6, 2010}}</ref> in New Haven, Connecticut, on December 24, 1994, at age 47.

==Legacy==
*During the late 1980s, the influence of [[Michel Foucault]]’s writings led to the emergence of a [[social constructivist]] view of human sexuality which emphasised the historical and cultural specificity of sexual identities such as 'heterosexual' and 'homosexual'. Despite Boswell’s friendly relations with Foucault, he remained adamantly opposed to the French theorist’s views, which he characterised as a reemergence of medieval [[nominalism]], and defended his own striking [[essentialism]] in the face of changing academic fashions. 
*Since his death, Boswell’s work has come under criticism from medievalists and [[Queer theory|queer theorists]], who—while acknowledging his personal courage in bringing the issue of sexuality into the academy—have pointed out the anachronism of speaking of "gay people" in pre-modern societies and have questioned the validity of Boswell’s conclusions.<ref>Paglia; Boswell Reviews, The Washington Post, July 17, 1994</ref><ref>[[Warren Johansson]] and [[William A. Percy]], ''[http://www.medievalists.net/2011/05/08/homosexuality-in-the-middle-ages/ Homosexuality in the Middle Ages'', "Medievalist.net", 2009].</ref> 
*Several other scholars, including [[Terry Castle]] and [[Ruth Vanita]], have followed in Boswell’s footsteps, building up the field of [[lesbian]] and [[gay]] studies (as distinct from [[queer theory]]), and proposing that categorizations of humans by sexual predilection much predate the 19th century (where Foucault and his followers place it), both in the West (as in [[Plato]]’s ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'') and in other cultures (''e.g.,'' [[India]]).
